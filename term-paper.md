# Final term paper

Based on the two previous milestone presentations, write a final workshop-grade paper (incl. code and data) on your NLP research on bias in search query suggestions. 

## Guidelines

- Latest submission is 31 August 2022. Please send a PDF to Philipp Schaer and Fabian Haak.
- Use CEUR-WS templates (https://de.overleaf.com/latex/templates/template-for-submissions-to-ceur-workshop-proceedings-ceur-ws-dot-org/hpvjjzhjxzjk)
- German or English is fine
- Approx. 4 pages per participant (ex. references). Please explicitly mark WHO wrote WHAT!
- We expect the groups to include a link to GitHub repository including their code and scripts. All code has to be documented and runable by us! Jupyter notebooks are fine but not a must-have.
- If you would like to include data (excerpts), please use Sciebo or other data repositories. Data upload is optional.

## Grading
- Grading for the whole team will be based on our rubic for Bachelor and Master theses: https://ir.web.th-koeln.de/theses/thesis-hints and includes the following criteria:
  1. Knowledge and skills (15%)
  2. Methodology and scientific approach (15%)
  3. Initiative and commitment, autonomy (20%)
  4. Quality of results (30%)
  5. Presentation of results (20%)
- In general, please see this term paper as a test phase for the upcomming Bachelor thesis!
