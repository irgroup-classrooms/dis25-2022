    "# Tutorial 2: Basic NLP Pipeline - Spacy\n",
    "The goal of the first tutorial is to create an NLP pipeline and get familiar with the common NLP modules. You will be able to handle most of the tasks with pandas as well as the nltk module, which are the basis for many NLP projects. Please use a (Jupyter) notebook for your code, for keeping things clean, performative and easy to annotate. Believe me, it's worth the extra effort!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to find Information\n",
    "Since you will not directly be able to solve all tasks just from what we provide in the lectures, we will provide you with some relevant materials and online-tutorials. Don't worry if you cannot solve a task; ask in the GitHub discussion forum or wait until we talk about it in the tutorial session.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python \n",
    "If you need a little refreshment of your Python skills or want to quickly find well-structured information on certain aspects of Python, check out the tutorials and documentation on [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Pandas \n",
    "Pandas is THE tool for tabular data in python. It comes with a lot of useful features, but is not always self-explanatory. However, there is an accelent [documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/index.html) and a superb [tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/pandas/default.asp) on Pandas, and we reccomend to check both out, especially the first few lessens of the tutorial! \n",
    "\n",
    "### NLTK\n",
    "NLTK, the natural language toolkit, as the name suggests, provides virtually everything you need for natural language processing in python. Although Spacy gets more popular quickly, NLTK is still the most used module for most preprocessing and analysis tasks. Find the documentation on the [official website](https://www.nltk.org/), but thanks to the popularity, almost every problem was already discussed and every question answered somewhere on the internet and almost always, a google search for a description of a problem or an error message leads to a solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Spacy\n",
    "\n",
    "Spacy is the latest and \"best\" NLP Python Framework. However, it is even further away from \"standard\" python than NLTK. Luckily, there is a very good tutorial on [the official website](https://course.spacy.io/en), not far away from where you can find the [excellent documentation](https://spacy.io/api). We recommend the introduction chapters of the documentation and the first two chapters of the Tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1: Installation and Import\n",
    "### 1.1 Installation and Import of NLP Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "The first Task is the same as in the first tutorial:\n",
    "Make sure that the required modules \"pandas\", \"numpy\", \"nltk\", \"sklearn\", \"spacy\" and \"re\" are imported and get the version numbers of the modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: Use <code>! pip install NAMEOFMODULE</code> to run command line / shell commands from your python jupyter notebook and install modules without having to use your terminal. "
