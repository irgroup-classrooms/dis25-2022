The blonde opened the bag and found the $10,000 with a note that said, \"How could you do this to a fellow Blonde?\"",

She wanted a pair of genuine alligator shoes in the worst way, but was very reluctant to pay the high prices the local vendors were asking. \nAfter becoming very frustrated with the \"no haggle\" attitude of one of the shopkeepers, the blonde shouted, \"Maybe I'll just go out and catch my own alligator so I can get a pair of shoes at a reasonable price!\" \nThe shopkeeper said, \"By all means, be my guest. Maybe you'll luck out and catch yourself a big one!\" \nDetermined, the blonde turned and headed for the swamps, set on catching herself an alligator. \nLater in the day, the shopkeeper was driving home, when he spotted the young woman standing waist deep in the water, shotgun in hand. Just then, he saw a huge 9-foot alligator swimming quickly toward her. She took aim, killed the creature, and with a great deal of effort hauled it on to the swamp bank. \nLying nearby were several more of the dead creatures. The shopkeeper watched in amazement. Just then the blonde flipped the alligator on its back, and frustrated, shouted out, \"Damn it, this one isn't wearing any shoes either!\"",

The detective conducting the interview looked at the three of them and said, \"So you all want to be a cop, eh?\"The blondes all nodded. The detective got up, opened a file drawer and pulled out a file folder. Sitting back down, he opened it up and withdrew a photograph, and said, \"To be a detect, you have to be able to DETECT. You must be able to notice things such as distinguishing features and oddities such as scars, etc.\" So saying, he stuck the photo in the face of the first blonde and withdrew it after about 2 seconds. \"Now, he said, \"Did you notice any distinguishing features about this man?\"The blonde immediately said, \"Yes, I did. He only has one eye!\"The detective shook his head and said, \"Of COURSE he only has one eye in this picture! It's a PROFILE of his face! You're dismissed!\"The first blonde hung her head and walked out of the office. The detective then turned to the second blonde, stuck the photo in her face for two seconds, pulled it back and said, \"What about you?

He only has one ear!\"The detective put his head in his hand and exclaimed, \"Didn't you hear what I just said to the other lady? This is a PROFILE of the man's face! Of COURSE you can only see one ear!! You're excused, too! You'd never make a good detective!\"The second blonde sheepishly walked out of the office.The detective turn his attention to the last blonde and said, \"This is probably a waste of time, but....\". He flashed the photo in her face for a couple of seconds and withdrew it, saying, \"Alright. Did YOU notice anything distinguishing or unusual about this man?\"The blonde said, \"Yes, I did. This man wears contact lenses.\"The detective frowned, took another look at the picture and began looking at some of the papers in the folder. He looked up at the blonde with a puzzled expression and said, \"You're absolutely right! His bio says he wears contacts! How in the world could tell that by looking at this picture?\"The blonde rolled her eyes and said, \"DUH! He has only one eye and one ear, he certainly CAN'T WEAR GLASSES!\"",

About a year later, he goes back to the bar, and they've got another jar of twenties there. \"What's the deal now?\" He asks. \"Well\",the bartender says,\"That damn horse won't stop laughing! So the first person who can make my horse stop laughing wins the money!\" The man pays his twenty, and goes out to the stable. He returns a few minutes later, and the horse is bawling his eyes out. He picks up his money and is about to leave when the bartender stops him. \"Alright\", he says,\"You have won an awful lot of money from me and I want to know how you did it!!\" \"Easy\", he says,\"I made him laugh by saying mine was bigger than his, and I made him cry by proving it!!\"",

When they reached the pearly gates, St. Peter took them to their mansion which was decked out with a beautiful kitchen and master bath suite and Jacuzzi. As they \"oohed and aahed\" the old man asked Peter how much all this was going to cost.\"It's free,\" Peter replied, \"this is Heaven.\"Next they went out back to survey the championship golf course that the home backed up to. They would have golfing privileges everyday and each week the course changed to a new one representing the great golf courses on earth. The old man asked, \"what are the green fees?\"Peter's reply, \"This is heaven, you play for free.\"Next they went to the club house and saw the lavish buffet lunch with the cuisine's of the world laid out.\"How much to eat?\" asked the old man. \"Don't you understand yet? This is heaven, it is free!\" Peter replied with some exasperation.\"Well, where are the low fat and low cholesterol tables?\" the old man asked timidly.Peter lectured, \"That's the best part . . . you can eat as much as you like of whatever you like and you never get fat and you never get sick. This is Heaven.\"With that the old man went into a fit of anger, throwing down his hat and stomping on it, and shrieking wildly.Peter and his wife both tried to calm him down, asking him what was wrong.The old man looked at his wife and said, \"This is all your fault. If it weren't for your bran muffins, I could have been here ten years ago!\"",

No reply. He moves 5 feet closer. Still no reply. He gets fed up and moves right behind her, about an inch away, and asks again, \"Honey, what's for dinner?\" She replies, \"For the fourth time, vegetable stew!\"",

Would you please tell the jury precisely what the defendant said when he called you,\" asked the prosecutor. \"I can't do that,\" the victim replied. \"It was so crude and disgusting. I can't use language like that.\" \"Would it help to just write it down?\" The victim wrote out every detail of what the obscene caller had said, and passed the note to the judge. The judge read the note. It was then passed to the prosecutor, the defense attorney, and finally to the jury. The sleeping juror was seated at the back corner of the jury box, and was the last to receive the note. He was awoken with a nudge from an attractive young juror, seated next to him, and she passed him the note. He read it, gazed in awe at the woman, and read it again. He turned to her, smiling broadly, and winked. He then put the note into his pocket.

Passengers around him are screaming, flailing, and drowning but our guy manages to grab on to a piece of driftwood and, using every last ounce of strength, swims a few miles through the shark-infested sea to a remote island. Sprawled on the shore nearly passed out from exhaustion, he turns his head and sees a woman lying near him, unconscious, barely breathing. She's also managed to wash up on shore from the sinking ship. He makes his way to her, and with some mouth-to-mouth assistance he manages to get her breathing again. She looks up at him, wide-eyed and grateful and says, \"My God, you saved my life!\" He suddenly realizes the woman is Cindy Crawford!Days and weeks go by. Cindy and our guy are living on the island together. They've set up a hut, there's fruit on the trees, and they're in heaven. Cindy's fallen madly in love with our man, and they're making passionate love morning, noon and night. Alas, one day she notices he's looking kind of glum. \"What's the matter, sweetheart?\" she asks, \"We have a wonderful life together, I'm in love with you. Is there something wrong? Is there anything I can do?\"He says, \"Actually, Cindy, there is. Would you mind, putting on my shirt?\" \"Sure,\" she says, \"if it will help.\" He takes off his shirt and she puts it on.\"Now would you put on my pants?\" he asks.\"Sure, honey, if it's really going to make you feel better,\" she says.\"Okay, would you put on my hat now, and draw a little mustache on your face?\" he asks.\"Whatever you want, sweetie,\" she says, and does.Then he says, \"Now, would you start walking around the edge of the island?\" She starts walking around the perimeter of the island. He sets off in the other direction. They meet up half way around the island a few minutes later. He rushes up to her, grabs her by the shoulders, and says, \"Dude!

There's plenty of food and water, and the weather is beautiful, so he's doing alright - but after a few months he gets lonely... The pig starts to look more and more attractive - soft, pink flesh, round buttocks, etc. But every time this poor guy makes an advance towards the pig, the Doberman snarls at him and once almost bit his leg. Very frustrating. One day the guy sees a speck on the horizon, so he swims out there and it turns out to be a dinghy, cast adrift, and in the bottom of the boat is a beautiful woman, unconscious. He drags her to shore and brings her into his hut and slowly nurses her back health. Finally she is well enough to walk and she says to him \"Thank you, thank you for saving my life. I don't know how I can ever repay you. I'll do anything for you, anything, just name it.\" The guy thinks for a minute and says, \"Would you mind taking my dog for a walk?\"",

EGGS:When something starts pecking its way out of the shell, the egg is probably past its prime. DAIRY PRODUCTS:Milk is spoiled when it starts to look like yoghurt.  Yoghurt is spoiled when it starts to look like cottage cheese.  Cottage cheese is spoiled when it starts to look like regular cheese.  Regular cheese is nothing but spoiled milk anyway and can't get any more spoiled than it is already.  Cheddar cheese is spoiled when you think it is blue cheese but you realise you've never purchased that kind. MAYONNAISE:If it makes you violently ill after you eat it, the mayonnaise is spoiled. FROZEN FOODS:Frozen foods that have become an integral part of the defrosting problem in your freezer compartment will probably be spoiled (or wreckedanyway) by the time you pry them out with a kitchen knife. EXPIRATION DATES:This is NOT a marketing ploy to encourage you to throw away perfectly good food so that you'll spend more on groceries.  Perhaps you'd benefit by having a calendar in your kitchen. MEAT:           If opening the refrigerator door causes stray animals from a three-block radius to congregate outside your house, the meat is spoiled. BREAD:Sesame seeds and Poppy seeds are the only officially acceptable \"spots\" that should be seen on the surface of any loaf of bread.  Fuzzy and hairy-looking white or green growth areas are a good indication that your bread has turned into a pharmaceutical laboratory experiment. FLOUR:Flour is spoiled when it wiggles. SALT:It never spoils. CANNED GOODS:Any canned goods that have become the size or shape of a tennis ball should be disposed of. Carefully. CARROTS:A carrot that you can tie a clove hitch in is not fresh. RAISINS AND SULTANAS:Raisins and sultanas should not be harder than your teeth. POTATOES:Fresh potatoes do not have roots, branches, or dense, leafy undergrowth. CHIP DIP:If you can take it out of its container and bounce it on the floor, it has gone bad. EMPTY CONTAINERS:Putting empty containers back into the refrigerator is an old trick, but it only works if you live with your mother or have a maid. UNMARKED ITEMS:You know it is well beyond prime when you're tempted to discard the Tupperware along with the food. Generally speaking, Tupperware containers should not burp when you open them. GENERAL RULE OF THUMB:Most food cannot be kept longer than the average life span of a hamster. Keep a hamster in or nearby your refrigerator to gauge this.",

Won't be able to send you the address as the last Arkansas family that lived here took the numbers with them for their house, so they wouldn't have to change their address.

It only rained twice this week, three days the first time and four days the second time. The coat you wanted me to send to you, Aunt Sue said it would be a little too heavy to send in the mail with them heavy buttons, so we cut them off and put them in the pockets. We got a bill from the funeral home, and it said if we didn't make the final payment on Grandma's funeral bill, up she comes. About your sister, she had a baby this morning. I haven't found out whether if it is a boy or girls so don  't know if you are an Aunt or Uncle. Your Uncle John fell in the whiskey vat. Some men tried to get him out, but he fought them off playfully, so he drowned. We cremated him and he burned for three days. Three of your friends went off the bridge in a pickup. One was driving and the other two were in the back. The driver got out. He rolled down the window and swam to safety. The other 2 drowned. They couldn't get the tailgate down. Not much more news this time. Nothing much happened. If you don't get this letter, please let me know and I will send another one.Love, Ma",

The gorilla catcher shows up in a big truck with a tool box in the back and a very large dog sitting on top of the tool box and a very large cage sitting in back of the tool box.  The gorilla catcher gets out of his truck and walks up to the man and shakes hands with him. The man then shows the gorilla catcher the tree and points up at the gorilla. After looking at the gorilla for a minute, the gorilla catcher walks back over to his truck and gets old Clyde off the tool box and gets out a gun and walks back over to the tree and sits the gun down next to old Clyde. The gorilla catcher looks over at the man and says, \"Here's the plan. I'm gonna climb this here tree and knock the gorilla out. When the gorilla hits the ground old Clyde here's gonna bite him in the nuts and hold on 'til I can get out of the tree and put the gorilla in the cage. Any questions?\"The man can't think of any so the gorilla catcher starts making his way up the tree. When the catcher gets almost halfway up the tree the man notices the shotgun next to old Clyde. He quickly calls up to the gorilla catcher and says, \"Hey, what's the gun for?\"The gorilla catcher replies, \"OH, that's in case the gorilla knocks me out of the tree, I want u to shoot old Clyde before i hit the ground.\"",

Your dad read in the newspaper that most accidents happen within 20 miles from home, so we moved. I won't be able to send you the address because the last Arkansas family that lived here took the house numbers when they moved so they wouldn't have to change their address.  This place is really nice. It even has a washing machine. I'm not sure it works so well though. Last week I put a load in and pulled the chain and haven't seen them since.  The weather isn't bad here. It only rained twice last week, the first time for three days and the second time for four days.  About that coat you wanted me to send you, your Uncle Stanley said it would be to heavy to send in the mail with the buttons on, so we cut them off and put them in the pockets.  John locked his keys in the car yesterday. We were really worried because it took him two hours to get me and your father out.  Your sister had a baby this morning, but I haven't found out what it is yet so I don't know if your an aunt or an uncle. The baby looks just like your brother.  Uncle Ted fell in a whiskey vat last week. Some men tried to pull him out, but he fought them off playfully and drowned. We had him cremated and he burned for three days.  Three of your friends ran off a bridge in a pick-up truck. Ralph was driving. He rolled down the window and swam to safety. Your other two friends were in back. They drowned because they couldn't get the tailgate down.  There isn't much more news at this time. Nothing much has happened.  Love, Mom  P. S. I was going to send you some money, but the envelope was already sealed.",

        "body": "One day an out of work mime was visiting the zoo, where he attempted to earn some money as a street performer. Unfortunately, as soon as he started to draw a crowd, a zoo keeper grabbed him and dragged him into his office. The zookeeper explained to the mime that the zoo's most popular attraction, a gorilla named Sparky, had died suddenly and the keeper was worried that attendance at the zoo would fall off without him. The zookeeper offered the mime a job to dress up as Sparky until they could get a new gorilla. The mime accepted.The next morning, the mime put on a gorilla suit and entered the cage before the crowd arrived. He discovered that it was a great job! He could sleep all he wanted, play and make fun of people and he was drawing bigger crowds than he ever did as a mime. However, eventually the crowds tired of him, and he was getting bored just swinging on tires. He began to notice that the people were paying more attention to the lion in the cage next to his. Not wanting to lose the attention of his audience, he climbed to the top of his cage, crawled across a partition, and dangled from the top over the lion's cage. Of course, this made the lion furious, but the crowd loved it. At the end of the day the zoo keeper was thrilled, and even gave the mime a raise for being such a good attraction. This went on for some time, the mime kept taunting the lion, the crowds grew larger, and his salary kept going up. Then one terrible day when he was dangling over the furious lion, he lost his grip and fell. The mime was terrified. The lion gathered itself and prepared to pounce. The mime was so scared that he began to run round and round the cage with the lion close behind. When no help came, and the crowd looked on in shock, the mime started screaming and yelling.Help, Help me!\" he screamed, but the lion was too quick and pounced. The mime found himself flat on his back looking up at the angry lion, who was just inches away from his face when he whispered, \"Shut up you idiot! Do you want to get us both fired?",

He would have a religious debate with a member of the Jewish community. If the Jew won, the Jews could stay. If the Pope won, the Jews would leave. The Jews realized that they had no choice. So they picked an elderly aged man named Moishe to represent them. Rabbi Moishe's Latin wasn't very good - in fact, he knew very little--but he was a man of great faith and well respected in the Jewish community. The pope agreed. What could be easier than a silent debate? \n\nThe day of the great debate came. Moishe and the Pope sat opposite each other for a full minute before the Pope raised his hand and showed three fingers. Moishe looked back at him and raised one finger. The Pope waved his fingers in a circle around his head. Moishe pointed to the ground where he sat. The Pope pulled out a wafer and a glass of wine. Moishe pulled out an apple. The Pope stood up and said, \"I give up. This man is too good. The Jews can stay.\" \n\nAn hour later, the cardinals were all around the Pope asking him what happened. The Pope said: \"First I held up three fingers to represent the Trinity. He responded by holding up one finger to remind me that there was still one God common to both our religions. Then I waved my finger around me to show him that God was all around us. He responded by pointing to the ground and showing that God was also right here with us. I pulled out the wine and the wafer to show that God absolves us from our sins. He pulled out an apple to remind me of original sin. He had an answer for everything. What could I do?\" \n\nMeanwhile, the Jewish community had crowded around Moishe. \"What happened?\" they asked. \"Well,\" said Moishe, \"First he said to me that the Jews had three days to get out of here. I told him that not one of us was leaving. Then he told me that this whole city would be cleared of Jews. I let him know that we were staying right here.\" \"And then?\" asked a woman. \"I don't know,\" said Moishe. \"He took out his lunch and I took out mine.\"",

As they walk through the market someone bumps into the boy at just the wrong moment and the coin goes straight into his mouth and lodges in his throat. He immediately starts choking and going blue in the face and Dad starts panicking, shouting and screaming for help.\n\nA middle-aged, fairly unremarkable man in a gray suit is sitting at a coffee bar in the market reading his newspaper and sipping a cup of coffee.

Reaching the boy (who is still standing, but just barely) the man carefully takes hold of the kid's testicles and squeezes gently but firmly.

Of course, this makes the lion furious, but the crowd loves it. At the end of the day the zookeeper comes and gives the mime a raise for being such a good attraction as a gorilla. Well, this goes on for some time. The mime keeps taunting the lion, the crowds grow larger, and his salary keeps going up. Then one terrible day when he is dangling over the furious lion, he slips and falls. The mime is terrified. The lion gathers itself and prepares to pounce. The mime is so scared that he begins to run round and round the cage with the lion close behind. Finally, the mime starts screaming and yelling, \"Help, Help me!\", but the lion is quick and pounces. The mime soon finds himself flat on his back looking up at the angry lion and the lion says, \"Shut up you idiot! Do you want to get us both fired?\"",

The alien, annoyed by what he perceived to be the gas pumps haughty attitude, drew his ray gun and said impatiently, \"Greetings earthling. We come in peace. How dare you ignore us in this way! Take us to your leader or I'll fire!\"\n\nThe other alien shouted to his comrade, \"No, you don't want to make him mad!\"\n\nBut before he finished his warning the first alien fired. There was a huge explosion that blew both of them 200 meters into the desert, where they landed in a heap rather abruptly. When they finally regained consciousness, the one who fired turned to the other one and said, \"What a ferocious creature. It damn near killed us! How did you know it was so dangerous?\" \n\nThe other alien answered, \"If there's one thing I've learned during my travels through the galaxy, when a guy has a pecker he can wrap around himself twice and then stick it in his own ear, you don't mess with him.\"",

Soon after there  was a tap on his shoulder, and he turned around to  see a big black bear.       The black bear said, \"That was a very bad mistake.  That was my cousin.

Right after, there was another tap on his shoulder. This time a huge grizzly bear stood right next to him.    The grizzly said, \"That was a big mistake, Bob.  That was my cousin and you've got two choices: Either I maul you to death or I have sex with you.\" Again, Bob thought it was better to cooperate with the grizzly bear than be mauled to death.

Now Bob was completely outraged, so he headed back to Alaska and managed to track down the grizzly bear and shoot it.  He felt sweet revenge, but then, moments later, there was a tap on his shoulder.  He turned around to find a giant polar bear standing there. The polar bear looked at him and said, \"Admit it Bob, you don't come here for the hunting, do you?\"",

He, being a devoted husband, protested, but she argued and said she was going to take some aspirin and go to bed, and there was no need of his good time being spoiled by not going. So he took his costume and away he went. The wife, after sleeping soundly for one hour, awakened without pain. As it was still early, she decided to go to the party. Since her husband did not know what her costume was, she thought she would have some fun watching him to see how he acted when she was not with him. She joined the party and soon spotted her husband cavorting around on the dance floor, dancing with every nice woman he could, copping a little feel here and a little kiss there. His wife sidled up to him. As a rather seductive babe herself, he left his partner high and dry and devoted his time to the new stuff that had just arrived. She let him go as far as he wished; naturally, since he was her husband. Finally he whispered a little proposition in her ear and she agreed, so off they went to one of the cars and had sex. Just before unmasking at midnight, she slipped away, went home, put the costume away and got into bed, wondering what kind of explanation he would make for his behavior.

He mixed some tap water, a stool sample from his dog, urine samples from his wife and daughter, and masturbated into the mixture for good measure.Jack hurries back to the drugstore, eager to check the results. He deposits ten dollars, pours in his concoction, and awaits the results.The computer prints the following:1. Your tap water is too hard. Get a water softener.2. Your dog has ringworm. Bathe him with anti-fungal shampoo.3. Your daughter has a cocaine habit. Get her into rehab.4. Your wife is pregnant...twin girls. They aren't yours. Get a lawyer.5.

Did he do any good deeds? Help his neighbor? Anything? No? St. Peter was becoming concerned. Exasperated, Peter says, \"Look, everybody does something nice sometime. Work with me, I'm trying to help. Now think!\" The man says, \"There was this old lady. I came out of a store and found her surrounded by a dozen Hell's Angels. They had taken her purse and were shoving her around, taunting and abusing her. I got so mad I threw my bags down, fought through the crowd, and got her purse back. I then helped her to her feet. I then went up to the biggest, baddest biker and told him how despicable, cowardly and mean he was and then spat in his face\". \"Wow\", said Peter, \"That's impressive.

However, they overslept and didn't make it back to Alabama until the morning of the exam. \n\nRather than take the final, they found their professor afterward to explain why they missed the final. They told him that they went up to the University of Tennessee for the weekend, and had planned to come back in time to study, but that they had a flat tire on the way back, and didn't have a spare, and couldn't get help for a long time, so they were late in getting back to campus. The professor thought this over and told them they could make up the final on the following day. The two guys were relieved. They studied that night and went in the next day for the final. The professor placed them in separate rooms, and handed each of them a test booklet and told them to begin. \n\nThey looked at the first problem, which was worth 5 points.

Brian: Not that it was all that great, just that her mom is staying with us for a couple of weeks and she was taking a shower at the time. DJ: Ooooooh, sneaky boy! Brian: On the kitchen table.

Within a month having smoked his entire stockpile of these great cigars and without yet having made even his first premium payment on the policy, the lawyer filed claim against the insurance company.In his claim, the lawyer stated the cigars were lost \"in a series of small fires.\"The insurance company refused to pay, citing the obvious reason: that the man had consumed the cigars in the normal fashion. The lawyer sued....and won!In delivering the ruling the judge agreed with the insurance company that the claim was frivolous. The Judge stated nevertheless, that the lawyer held a policy from the company in which it had warranted that the cigars were insurable and also guaranteed that it would insure them against fire,without defining what is considered to be unacceptable fire,\" and was obligated to pay the claim.Rather than endure lengthy and costly appeal process, the insurance company accepted the ruling and paid $15,000.00 to the lawyer for his loss of the rare cigars lost in the \"fires.\"NOW FOR THE BEST PART... After the lawyer cashed the check, the insurance company had him arrested on 24 counts of ARSON!!!! With his own insurance claim andtestimony from the previous case being used against him, the lawyer was convicted of intentionally burning his insured property and was sentenced to 24 months in jail and a $24,000.00 fine.This is a true story and was the 1st place winner in the recent Criminal Lawyers Award Contest.ONLY IN AMERICA",

Finally one day Justin said to Christian, \"I'm bored and frustrated at being a prawn; I wish I was a shark, and then I wouldn't have any worries about being eaten...\"As Justin had his mind firmly on becoming a predator, a mysterious cod appears and says, \"Your wish is granted\", and lo and behold, Justin turned into a shark.Horrified, Christian immediately swam away, afraid of being eaten by his old mate.  Time went on (as it invariably does...) and Justin found himself becoming bored and lonely as a shark.  All his old mates simply swam away whenever he came close to them.  Justin didn't realise that his new menacing appearance was the cause of his sad plight.While out swimming alone one day he sees the mysterious cod again and can't believe his luck.Justin figured that the fish could change him back into a prawn.  He begs the cod to change him back so, lo and behold; he is turned back into a prawn.  With tears of joy in his tiny little eyes, Justin swam back to his friends and bought them all a cocktail. (The punch line does not involve a prawn cocktail - it's much worse).Looking around the gathering at the reef, he searched for his old pal. \"Where's Christian?\" he asked. \"He's at   home, distraught that his best friend changed sides to the enemy and became a shark\", came the reply.Eager to put things right again and end the mutual pain and torture, he set off to Christian's house.  As he opened the coral gate the memories came flooding back.  He banged on the door and shouted, \"It's me, Justin, your old friend, come out and see me again.\"Christian replied \"No way man, you'll eat me. You're a shark, the enemy and I'll not be tricked. \"Justin cried back \"No, I'm not.  That was the old me.  I'vechanged.\"...............................\"I've found Cod.

        "body": "1 star hangover * - No pain.  No real feeling of illness. You slept in your own bed and when you woke up there were no traffic cones in there with you.  You are still able to function relatively well on the energy stored up from all those vodka red bulls. However, you can drink 10 bottles of water and still feel as parched as the Sahara. Even vegetarians are craving a Cheeseburger and a side of fries.2 star hangover * * - No pain, but something is definitely amiss. You may look okay but you have the attention span and mental capacity of a stapler.   The coffee you hug to try and remain focused is only exacerbating your rumbling gut, which is craving a full English breakfast. Although you have a nice demeanour about the office, you are costing your employer valuable money because all you really can handle is some light filing, followed byaimlessly surfing the net and writing junk e-mails.3 star hangover * * * - Slight headache. Stomach feels crap. You are definitely a space cadet and not so productive. Anytime a girl or lad walks by you gag because her perfume / aftershave reminds you of the random gin shots you did with your alcoholic friends, after the bouncer kicked you out at 1:45 a.m. Life would be better right now if you were in your bed with a dozen doughnuts and a litre of coke watching daytime TV. You've had 4 cups of coffee, a gallon of water, 2 Sausage Rolls and a litre of diet coke yet you haven't peed once.4 star hangover * * * * - You have lost the will to live. Your head is throbbing and you can't speak too quickly or else you might spew. Your boss has already lambasted you for being late and has given you a lecture for reeking of booze. You wore nice clothes, but you smell of socks, and you can't hide the fact that you either missed an oh-so crucial spot shaving or it looks like you put your make-up on while riding the dodgemsdepending on your gender. Your teeth have their own individual sweaters. Your eyeslook like one big vein and your hairstyle makes you look like a reject from the second-grade class picture circa 1976. You would give a week's pay for one of the following:Home time, doughnut and somewhere to be alone, or a Time machine so you could go back and NOT have gone out the night before. You scare small children in the street just by walking past them.5 star hangover * * * * * - You have a second heartbeat in your head, which is actually annoying the employee who sits next to you. Vodka vapour is seeping out of every pore and making you dizzy. You still have toothpaste crust in the corners of your mouth from brushing your teeth. Your body has lost the ability to generate saliva, so your tongue is suffocating you. You'd cry but that would take the last of the moisture left in your body.    Death seems pretty good right now. Your boss doesn't even get mad at you and your co-workers think that your dog just died because you look so pathetic.   You should have called in sick because, let's face it, all you can manage to do is breathe ... very gently.6 star hangover * * * * * * - You arrive home and climb into bed. Sleep comes instantly; as you were fighting it all the way home in the taxi.  You get about 2 hours sleep until the noises inside your head wake you up.  You notice that your bed has been cleared for take off and is flying relentlessly around the room. No matter what you do you now, you're going to chuck. You stumble out of bed and now find that your room is in ayacht under full sail. After walking along the skirting boards on alternating walls knocking off all the pictures, you find the toilet. If you are lucky you will remember to lift the lid before you spontaneously explode and wake the whole house up with your impersonation of walrus mating calls. You sit there on the floor in your undies, cuddling the only friend in the world you have left (the toilet), randomly continuing to make the walrus noises, spitting, and farting.  Help usually comes at this stage, even if it is short lived. Tears stream down your face and your abdomen hurts. Help now turns into abuse and he/she usually goes back to bed leaving you there in the dark. With your stomach totally empty, your spontaneous eruptions have died back to 15-minute intervals, but your body won't relent. You are convinced that you are starting to turn yourself inside out and swear that you saw your tonsils projectile out your mouth on the last occasion. It is now dawn and you pass your disgusted partner getting up for the day as you try to climb into bed.   She / He abuses you again for trying to get into bed with lumpy bits of dried vomit in your hair. You reluctantly accept their advice and have a shower in exchange for them driving you to the hospital. Work is not an option.",

        "body": "Once upon a time there lived a woman who had a maddening passion for baked beans. She loved them but unfortunately they had always had a very embarrassing and somewhat lively reaction to her. Then one day she met a guy and fell in love. When it became apparent that they would marry she thought to herself, \" He is such a sweet and gentle man, he would never go for this carrying on.\" So she made the supreme sacrifice and gave up beans. Some months later her car broke down on the way home from work. Since she lived in the country she called her husband and told him that she would be late because she had to walk home. On her way she passed a small diner and the odor of the baked beans was more than she could stand. Since she still had miles to walk, she figured that she would walk off any ill effects by the time she reached home. So, she stopped at the diner and before she knew it, she had consumed three large orders of baked beans. All the way home she putt-putted. And upon arriving home she felt reasonably sure she could control it. Her husband seemed excited to see her and exclaimed delightedly, \"Darling, I have a surprise for dinner tonight.\" He then blindfolded her and led her to her chair at the table. She seated herself and just as he was about to remove the blindfold from his wife, the telephone rang. He made her promise not to touch the blindfold until he returned. He then went to answer the phone. The baked beans she had consumed were still affecting her and the pressure was becoming almost unbearable, so while her husband was out of the room she seized the opportunity, shifted her weight to one leg and let it go. It was not only loud, but it smelled like a fertilizer truck running over a skunk in front of pulpwood mill. She took her napkin and fanned the air around her vigorously. Then, she shifted to the other cheek and ripped three more, which reminded her of cabbage cooking. Keeping her ears tuned to the conversation in the other room, she went on like this for another ten minutes. When the phone farewells signaled the end of her freedom, she fanned the air a few more times with her napkin, placed it on her lap and folded her hands upon it, smiling contentedly to herself. She was the picture of innocence when her husband returned, Apologizing for taking so long, he asked her if she peeked, and she assured him that she had not. At this point, he removed the blindfold, and she was surprised!!! There were twelve dinner guests seated around the table to wish her a Happy Birthday!!!",

        "body": "Q: I've heard that cardiovascular exercise can prolong life. Is this true?\n\nA: Your heart is only good for so many beats, and that's it... don't waste them on exercise. Everything wears out eventually. Speeding up your heart will not make you live longer; that's like saying you can extend the life of your car by driving it faster. Want to live longer? Take a nap.\n\nQ: Should I cut down on meat and eat more fruits and vegetables?\n\nA: You must grasp logistical efficiencies. What does a cow eat?  Hay and corn. And what are these?vegetables. So a steak is nothing more than an efficient mechanism of delivering vegetables to your system. Need grain? Eat chicken. Beef is also a good source of field grass (green leafy vegetable).  And a pork chop can give you 100% of your recommended daily\nallowance of vegetable slop. \n\nQ: Is beer or wine bad for me?\n\nA: Look, it goes to the earlier point about fruits and vegetables.  As we all know, scientists divide everything in the world into three categories: animal,\nmineral, and vegetable. We all know that beer and wine are not animal, and they are not on the periodic table\nof elements, so that only leaves one thing, right? My advice: Have a burger\nand a beer and enjoy your liquid vegetables.\n\nQ: How can I calculate my body/fat ratio?\n\nA: Well, if you have a body, and you have body fat, your ratio is one to one. If you have two bodies, your\nratio is two to one, etc.\n\nQ: What are some of the advantages of participating in a regular exercise program?\n\nA: Can't think of a single one, sorry. My philosophy is: No Pain - Good.\n\nQ: If I stop smoking, will I live longer?\n\nA: Nope. Smoking is a sign of individual statement and peace of mind. If you stop, you'll probably stress\nyourself to death in record time.\n\nQ: Aren't fried foods bad for you?\n\nA: You're not listening. Foods are fried these days in vegetable oil. In fact, they're permeated in it. How\ncould getting more vegetables be bad for you?\n\nQ: What's the secret to healthy eating?\n\nA: Thicker gravy.\n\nQ: Will sit-ups help prevent me from getting a little soft around the middle?\n\nA: Definitely not! When you exercise a muscle, it gets bigger.  You should only be doing sit-ups if you want\na bigger stomach.\n\nQ: Is chocolate bad for me?\n\nA: Are you crazy? Cocoa beans... Another vegetable. It's the best feel good food around!\n\nI hope this has cleared up any misconceptions you may have had about food and diets.\n\nHave a cookie... flour is a veggie!",

The penguin drives around the corner to a service station and asks the mechanic to take a look at it. The mechanic says he has a few others to look at first but if he comes back in an hour he can tell the penguin what is wrong with his car. The penguin agrees and goes for a walk. He finds an ice cream shop and thinks a big bowl of vanilla ice cream will really hit the spot since he's a penguin and it's Arizona in the summer, after all. He sits down at the counter and starts in on his ice cream. Of course he has no hands so it is rather messy. By the time he is done he has ice cream all over his flippers and his mouth - a total mess. He walks back to the service station and says to the mechanic, \"Did you find out what is wrong with my car?\" The mechanic replies, \"It looks like you've blown a seal.\" \"No, no,\" says the penguin. \"It's just ice cream, I swear!!!\"",

        "body": "We've all been there but don't like to admit it. We've all kicked back in our cubicles and suddenly felt something brew down below. As much as we try to convince ourselves otherwise, the WORK POOP is inevitable. For those who hate pooping at work, following is the 2001 Survival Guide for taking a dump at work. Memorize these definitions and pooping at work will become a pure pleasure.ESCAPEE.Definition: a fart that slips out while taking a leak at the urinal or forcing a poop in a stall. This is usually accompanied by a sudden wave of panic embarrassment. This is similar to the hot flash you receive when passing an unseen police car and speeding. If you release an escapee, do not acknowledge it. Pretend it did not happen. If you are standing next to the farter in the urinal, pretend you did not hear it. No one likes an escapee, it is uncomfortable for all involved. Making a joke or laughing makes both parties feel uneasy.JAILBREAK (Used in conjunction with ESCAPEE).Definition: When forcing poop, several farts slip out at a machine gun pace. This is usually a side effect of diarrhea or a hangover. If this should happen, do not panic. Remain in the stall until everyone has left the bathroom so to spare everyone the awkwardness of what just occurred.COURTESY FLUSH.Definition: The act of flushing the toilet the instant the nose cone of the poop log hits the water and the poop is whisked away to an undisclosed location. This reduces the amount of air time the poop has to stink up the bathroom. This can help you avoid being caught doing the WALK OF SHAME.WALK OF SHAME.Definition: Walking from the stall, to the sink, to the door after you have just stunk up the bathroom. This can be a very uncomfortable moment if someone walks in and busts you. As with all farts, it is best to pretend that the smell does not exist. Can be avoided with the use of the COURTESY FLUSH.OUT OF THE CLOSET POOPER.Definition: A colleague who poops at work and damn proud of it. You will often see an Out Of The Closet Pooper enter the bathroom with a newspaper or magazine under their arm. Always look around the office for the Out Of The Closet Pooper before entering the bathroom.THE POOPING FRIENDS NETWORK (PFN).Definition: A group of coworkers who band together to ensure emergency pooping goes off without incident. This group can help you to monitor the whereabouts of Out Of The Closet Poopers, and identify SAFE HAVENS.SAFE HAVENS.Definition: A seldom used bathroom somewhere in the building where you can least expect visitors. Try floors that are predominantly of the opposite sex. This will reduce the odds of a pooper of your sex entering the bathroom.TURD BURGLAR:Definition: A pooper who does not realize that you are in the stall and tries to force the door open. This is one of the most shocking and vulnerable moments that can occur when taking a dump at work. If this occurs, remain in the stall until the Turd Burglar leaves. This way you will avoid all uncomfortable eye contact.CAMO-COUGH.Definition: A phony cough that alerts all new entrants into the bathroom that you are in a stall. This can be used to cover-up a WATERMELON, or to alert potential Turd Burglars. Very effective when used in conjunction with an ASTAIRE.ASTAIRE.Definition: A subtle toe-tap that is used to alert potential Turd Burglars that you are occupying a stall. This will remove all doubt that the stall is occupied. If you hear an Astaire, leave the bathroom immediately so the pooper can poop in peace.WATERMELON.Definition: A turd that creates a loud splash when hitting the toilet water. This is also an embarrassing incident. If you feel a Watermelon coming on, create a diversion. See CAMO-COUGH.HAVANA OMELET.Definition: A load of diarrhea that creates a series of loud splashes in the toilet water. Often accompanied by an Escapee. Try using a Camo-Cough with an Astaire.UNCLE TED.Definition: A bathroom user who seems to linger around forever. Could spend extended lengths of time in front of the mirror or sitting on the pot. An Uncle Ted makes it difficult to relax while on the crapper, as you should always wait to drop your load when the bathroom is empty. This benefits you as well as the other bathroom attendees.FLY BY.Definition: The act of scouting out a bathroom before pooping. Walk in and check for other poopers. If there are others in the bathroom, leave and come back again. Be careful not to become a FREQUENT FLYER. People may become suspicious if they catch you constantly going into the bathroom.",

Seeing it was a fair-sized gorilla tearing the shingles off his home, he promptly called up the local zoo authorities to inform them one of their animals had escaped. He was reassured that a gorilla recovering units was on the way and to remain calm. A few minutes later, an old beat up truck, displaying the Gorilla recovery unit logo on its panels, pulled up to the house. The elderly driver proceeds to recover from the back of the truck, a chihuahua dog, a pair of handcuffs, a ladder, a baseball bat, and a 12-gauge shotgun. Puzzled on how this lone elderly was to solve the problem of this gorilla that had by now torn half the roof apart, the chap asked him how he would go about doing this. As he handed him over the 12-gauge shotgun, the zoo employee explained the plan: \"First I'll climb up there with the ladder. Then I'll approach the gorilla and knock him off the roof using the baseball bat. As soon as the gorilla hits the ground, the specially trained chihuahua will attack its private parts. When I get back on the ground, the gorilla will have lowered its hands to its groin area to protect itself thus making it easy for me to slip on the handcuffs. Then, I lead him to the truck, lock him up and take him back to the zoo...\" Amazed at the procedure, the somewhat startled house owner asked why he was handed the 12-gauge shotgun? \"Well,\" explained the experienced gorilla retriever, \"It's just a precaution should things not go exactly as planned. In the unlikely event that once on the roof, the gorilla knocks me off with the baseball, shoot the dog.\".",

Your skin colour tells me you have been on vacation. The ink-spot on your right index finger suggests to me that you are a writer. Your clothing is very English, and not French.

I said, 'I don't know, my calendar has no 'seven's on it.'I saw a man with a wooden leg, and a real foot.I replaced the headlights on my car with strobe lights.

I sat beside her. I said, 'Hi,' and she said, 'Hi,' and then I said, 'Nice day, isn't it?' and she said, 'I saw my analyst today and he says I have a problem.' So I asked, 'What's the problem?' She replied, 'I can't tell you. I don't even know you.' I said, 'Well sometimes it's good to tell your problems to a perfect stranger on a bus.' So she said, 'Well, my analyst said I'm a nymphomaniac and I only like Jewish cowboys. By the way, my name is Denise.' I said, 'Hello, Denise. I'm Bucky Goldstein.'Ever notice how irons have a setting for PERMANENT press? I don't get it.I Xeroxed a mirror. Now I have an extra Xerox machine. Sponges grow in the ocean. That just kills me.

He dropped his camera and ran. And kept running....... and looking behind him, he noticed the bear was gaining on him.  He was so scared that tears came to his eyes.  He ran faster, but the bear was closing in on him.  He ran faster yet, and tripped over a root.  Rolling over onto his back, the athiest saw the bear rise to his full height and raise a huge paw...... and the athiest cried out, \"Oh, God, no!\"And everything stopped.  The birds stopped chirping.  The brook stopped babbling.  The gentle breeze stopped.  And the bear froze with his paw in the air.  And the athiest heard a booming voice say, \"Young man.  For years you doubted my very existance, but now that your life is in peril you call my name to help you.  Why should I do so?\"And the athiest thought for a moment, and said, \"Yes, you are right.  If you are God, then it would be hypocritical of me to become a Christian at this point in my life.  But, do you think that you could at least make the bear a Christian for today?\"  And the booming voice was quiet for a moment and then said, \"Done.\"And everything started again.

An industry source said that the deal had been in the works about 1300 years. While details were not available at press time, it is believed that the overhead cost of having twelve days of Christmas and eight days of Hanukkah was becoming prohibitive for both sides. By combining forces, we're told, the world will be able to enjoy consistently high-quality service during the Fifteen Days of Chrismukah, as the new holiday is being called.\n\nMassive layoffs are expected, with lords a-leaping and maids a-milking being the hardest hit. As part of the conditions of the agreement, the letters on the dreidel, currently in Hebrew, will be replaced by Latin, thus becoming unintelligible to a wider audience.\n\nAlso, instead of translating to \"A great miracle happened there,\" the message on the dreidel will be the more generic: \"Miraculous stuff happens.\" In exchange, it is believed that Jews will be allowed to use Santa Claus and his vast merchandising resources for buying and delivering their gifts.\n\nOne of the sticking points holding up the agreement for at least three hundred years was the question of whether Jewish children could leave milk and cookies for Santa even after having eaten meat for dinner. A breakthrough came last year, when Oreos were finally declared to be Kosher. All sides appeared happy about this.\n\nFortunately for all concerned, he said, Kwanzaa will help to maintain the competitive balance. He then closed the press conference by leading all present in a rousing rendition of \"Oy Vey, All Ye Faithful.\"",

We have not addressed networking aspects yet, so currently only one person at a time can use MYASS. This restriction will be removed after MYASS expands. \n\nSome employees have begun using the program already. This morning I walked into a subordinate's office and was not surprised to find that he had his nose buried in MYASS. Some of the less technical people may be somewhat afraid of MYASS. Last week my secretary said to me, \"I'm a little nervous, I never put anything in MYASS before.\" I helped her through the first time and afterward she admitted that it was relatively painless and she was actually looking forward to doing it again, and was even ready to kiss MYASS. \n\nThere have been concerns over the virus that was found in MYASS upon initial installation, but the virus has been eliminated and we were able to save MYASS. In the future, however, protection will be required prior to entering MYASS. This database will encompass all information associated with the business. \n\nAs you begin using the program, feel free to put anything you want in MYASS. As MYASS grows larger, we envision a time when it will be commonplace for a supervisor to hand work to an employee and say, \"here, stick this in MYASS.\" It will be a great day when we need data quickly and our employees can respond, \"Here it is, I just pulled it out of MYASS.\"",

There was nothing left of his dog at all. \n\nOsama came up to Bush, shaking his head in disbelief, \"We don't understand how this could have happened.  We had our best people working for 5 years with the meanest Doberman and Rottweiler female dogs in the world and the biggest, meanest Siberian wolves.\" \n\n\"That's nothing,\", said Bush.  \"We had Michael Jackson's plastic surgeons working for 5 years to make that alligator look like a weenie dog.\" \n\nGOD BLESS AMERICA!!!!!!!!!",

And with that, the CEO emptied a bucket of mud all over his hallway carpet.\n\n\"If this vacuum cleaner does not remove all traces of this mess from your carpet, sir, I will personally eat the remainder. I am the CEO! You have my GUARANTEE!\"\n\n\"I got a better idea\" said the old man, \"If you don't clean it all up, I'll swap those fancy clothes of yours fer my overalls. Your nice suit, your tie, your shoes, everything!\"\n\n\"Fine, sir!\" said the CEO confidently. \"I'll give you my clothes!\"\n\n\"Lemme ask you somethin', pal...Where are you goin' when you leave here?\"\n\nThe CEO answered very confidently: \"To a VERY important conference! WHY?\"\n\n\"Will they let you in if yer barefoot?\" said the old man.\n\n\"Of course not!\" said the CEO.\n\n\"How much did you pay for those socks you'v got on?\" asked the old man.\n\n\"Fifty dollars\" said the bewildered CEO.\n\n\"I ain't never worn fifty dollar socks before!\" said the old man. \"It will be kinda hard for you to wear overalls to work, I guess!\" said the old man.\n\n\"WHAT?!\" said the confused CEO.\n\n\"And will you show how me to tie a necktie?\" said the old man...\n\nOne hour later, the door of the apartment opened, and the CEO carefully looked out. Seeing that no one was around, his foot appeared.\n\nA bare foot.\n\nHe stepped out into the hallway - dressed only in overalls and bare feet. His expensive executive suit and tie had vanished, along with his confidence and dignity.\n\nThe old man watched him run away to his car with a grin, admiring the expensive pinstriped suit and silk tie he had just acquired. He then sat down and pulled on the CEO's fifty dollar socks and gleaming shoes.\n\n\"Now I gotta see about payin' that electric bill...\"",

This makes for an interesting argument when both parties are SMART. Stage 2 - GOOD LOOKING  This is when you realise that you are the BEST LOOKING person in the entire bar and that people fancy you. You can go up to a perfect stranger knowing they fancy you and really want to talk to you. Bear in mind that you are still SMART, so you can talk to this person about any subject under the sun. Stage 3 - RICH  This is when you suddenly become the richest person in the world. You can buy drinks for the entire bar because you have an armoured truck full of money parked behind the bar. You can also make bets at this stage, because of course, you are still SMART, so naturally you win all your bets. It doesn't matter how much you bet 'cos you are RICH.  You will also buy drinks for everyone that you fancy, because now you are the BEST LOOKING person in the world. Stage 4 - BULLET PROOF  You are now ready to pick fights with anyone and everyone especially those with whom you have been betting or arguing. This is because nothing can hurt you. At this point you can also go up to the partners of the people who you fancy and challenge to a battle of wits or money. You have no fear of losing this battle because you are SMART, you are RICH and hell, you're BETTER LOOKING than they are anyway! Stage 5 - INVISIBLE  This is the Final Stage of Drunkenness. At this point you can do anything because NO ONE CAN SEE YOU. You dance on a table to impress the people who you fancy because the rest of the people in the room cannot see you. You are also invisible to the person who wants to fight you. You can walk through the street singing at the top of your lungs because no one can see or hear you and because you're still SMART you know all the words.",

Represent the  set \"C\" as a subset of set \"M\" and answer the following question: What is the  cardinality of the set \"P\" for profits? Teaching Math in 1980: A logger sells a truckload of lumber for $100.  Her cost of production is $80 and her profit is $20. Your assignment:  Underline the number 20. Teaching Math in 1990: By cutting down beautiful forest trees, the logger  makes $20. What do you think of this way of making aliving? Topic for  class participation after answering the question:How did the forest birds and  squirrels feel as the logger cut downthe trees? There are no wrong answers. Teaching Math in 1996: By laying off 40% of its loggers, acompany  improves its stock price from $80 to $100. How muchcapital gain per share  does the CEO make by exercising his stockoptions at $80? Assume capital  gains are no longer taxed,because this encourages savings. Teaching Math in 1997: A company outsources all of its loggers.The firm  saves on benefits, and when demand for its product isdown, the logging  work force can easily be cut back. The averagelogger employed by the company  earned $50,000, had three weeksvacation, a nice retirement plan and medical  insurance. Thecontracted logger charges $50 an hour. Was outsourcing a  good move? Teaching Math in 1998: A laid-off logger with four kids at home anda  ridiculous alimony from his first failed marriage comes into thelogging  company corporate offices and goes postal, mowing down16 executives and a  couple of secretaries, and gets lucky when henails a politician on the  premises collecting his kickback. Wasoutsourcing the loggers a good move  for thecompany? Teaching Math in 1999: A laid-off logger serving time in Folsom for  blowing away several people is being trained as a COBOLprogrammer in  order to work on Y2K projects. What is theprobability that the automatic cell  doors will open on their own as of00:01, 01/01/2000?",

Instead of beer belly, you'd get \"beer biceps.\" Instead of an expensive engagement ring, you could present your wife-to-be  with a giant foam hand that said, \"You're #1!\" Valentine's Day would be moved to February 29th so it would only occur in  leap years. On Groundhog Day, if you saw your shadow, you'd get the day off to go  drinking. Mother's Day, too.St. Patrick's Day, however, would remain  exactly the same. But it would be celebrated every month. Cops would be broadcast live, and you could phone in advice to the pursuing  cops. Or to the crooks. Two words: ALLY MCNAKED. Regis and Kathie Lee would be chained to a cement mixer and pushed off the  Golden Gate Bridge for the most lucrative pay-per-view event in world  history. The only show opposite \"Monday Night Football\" would be \"Monday Night  Football From A Different Camera Angle.\" It would be perfectly legal to steal a sports car, as long as you returned  it the following day with a full tank of gas.Every man would get four real \"Get Out of Jail Free\" cards per year. When a cop gave you a ticket, every smart-aleck answer you responded with  would actually reduce your fine.As in: Cop: \"You know how fast you were  going?\"  You: \"All I know is, I was spilling my beer all over the place.\"  Cop: \"Nice one.That's $10 off.\" Faucets would run \"Hot,\" \"Cold,\" and \"100 proof.\" The Statue of Liberty would get a bright red, 40-foot thong. People would never talk about how fresh they felt. Daisy Duke shorts would never again go out of style. Telephones would automatically cut off after 30 seconds of conversation.",

For example, most  people don't know  that back in 1912 Hellman's mayonnaise was manufactured in England. The  \"Titanic\" was carrying 12,000 jars of the condiment scheduled for delivery  in Vera Cruz, Mexico which  was to be the next port of call for the great ship after New York City. The  Mexican people were eagerly awaiting delivery and were disconsolate at the  loss. So much so that they  declared a national day of mourning which they still observe today. It is known, of course, as Sinko de Mayo.",

He had several hundred young layers, called pullets, and 8 or 10 roosters whose job was to fertilize the eggs.My uncle kept records and any rooster or pullet that didn't perform well went into the pot and was replaced. Now this took an awful lot of time. So when my uncle saw a set of eight tiny bells that each rang a different tone he promptly bought them.He glued a piece of foam rubber to each clapper shaft so the bell wouldn't ring except when violently shaken. He hung a bell on each rooster's neck and went and mixed a Mint Julep. Now he could sit on the porch and sip while filling out an efficiency report on the roosters by listening to the different tones of the bells and marking down each encounter. My uncle's favorite rooster was old Brewster. Brewster was a fine specimen, but his bell didn't ring all morning. Uncle went to investigate.Several roosters were chasing pullets, bells a-ringing. Brewster had his bell in his beak so it couldn't ring. He'd sneak up on a pullet, do his job and walk on to the next one. Chagrined at first, Uncle was soon so proud of Brewster he entered him in the county fair.Brewster was an overnight sensation. They not only awarded him the No Bell prize but also the Pullet Surprise.",

He called the police.Since there did not appear to be any foul play, the police referred the preacher to the health department. They said since there was no health threat that he should call the sanitation department.The sanitation manager said he could not pick up the mule without authorization from the mayor.Now the preacher knew the mayor and was not to eager to call him. The mayor had a bad temper and was generally hard to deal with, but the preacher called him anyway.The mayor did not disappoint. He immediately began to rant and rave at the pastor and finally said, \"Why did you call me anyway? Isn't it your job to bury the dead?\"The preacher paused for a brief prayer and asked the Lord to direct his response. He was led to say, \"Yes, Mayor, it is my job to bury the dead, but I always like to notify the next of kin first!\"",

I was stopped at the light at a busy intersection, just lost in thought about the Lord, and didn't notice that the light had changed. That bumper sticker really worked! I found lots of people who love Jesus. Why, the guy behind me started to honk like crazy. He must REALLY love the Lord because pretty soon, he leaned out his window and yelled, \"Jesus Christ!\" as loud as he could. It was like a football game with him shouting, \"GO JESUS CHRIST, GO!\" Everyone else started honking, too, so I leaned out my window and waved and smiled to all of those loving people. There must have been a guy from Florida back there because I could hear him yelling something about a sunny beach, and saw him waving in a funny way with only his middle finger stuck up in the air. I asked my two kids what that meant. They kind of squirmed, looked at each other, giggled and told me that it was the Hawaiian good luck sign. So, I leaned out the window and gave him the good luck sign back. Several cars behind, a very nice black man stepped out of his car and yelled something. I couldn't hear him very well, but it sounded like, \"Mother trucker,\" or \"Mother's from there.\" Maybe he was from Florida, too. He must really love the Lord. A couple of the people were so caught up in the joy of the moment that they got out of their cars and were walking toward me. I bet they wanted to pray, but just then I noticed that the light had changed to yellow, and stepped on the gas. And a good thing I did, because I was the only driver to get across the intersection. I looked back at them standing there. I leaned way out the window, gave them a big smile and held up the Hawaiian good luck sign as I drove away. Praise the Lord for such wonderful folks.",

Sidney started the experiment with the bull frog, and told Sophie her job was to write down the results of the experiment.Sidney drew a line in the sand, placed the frog on the line, and prodded the frog with a small twig from the rear and shouted, \"Jump frog!\"The frog jumped and Sidney measured the distance. \"12 feet. Write that down, Sophie.\" he said.Next, he brought the frog back to the starting point and removed the frog's right front leg. Again he prodded the frog and shouted, \"Jump frog!\" The frog jumped 10 feet, and on instruction Sophie wrote it down.Again the frog was brought back, and the left front leg was removed, and again said, \"Jump frog!\" It jumped 6 feet and Sophie wrote it down.Again Sidney tried, this time removing the large right back leg. \"Jump frog! Jump frog!\" he shouted and prodded the frog. The frog jumped 8 inches. \"Write it down, Sophie.\"Finally Sidney removed the frog's remaining back left leg, put it down and prodded the frog with the twig, shouting \"Jump frog! Jump Frog! JUMP FROG! JUMP, JUMP FROG!\"The frog didn't jump. Sophie looked at Sidney, and said, \"So what should I write down?\"Sidney thought a moment, and told Sophie to write, \"When you remove all the legs from a frog, it turns deaf.\"",

They agreed to give each other5 years to breed the two most powerful fighting dogs ever.The winning dog's country would be entitled to dominate the world. The losing side would have to submit and lay down its arms.The Russians searched their vast country to find the meanest, most vicious Doberman and Rottweiler breeds and crossed them with the biggest, most dangerous Siberian wolves.They selected only the biggest and strongest puppy from each litter and fed it a diet of steroids and trained them to be lethal attack dogs. After five years of fierce breeding, Russiahad managed to create the biggest, most vicious dog the world had ever seen.Finally Russia and America met in Switzerland to let their dogs fight for world domination. Although its cage had 4-inch-thick reinforced steel-bars, everyone was afraid to even go near the Russian monster-dog. When the Russians saw the American dog, they burst into laughter. America had sent a weird looking 9-foot-long Dachshund! The Russian breeders felt a little sorry for the Dachshund, because they knew it didn't have the slightest chance to last even 10 seconds against Russia's killer.When the bell announced the beginning of the fight, the Russian dog leaped out of its cage, snarled, and charged the American Dachshund.The Dachshund slowly waddled out of its cage towards the Russian dog. But just when the Russian champion looked like it was going to bite the Dachshund's neck, the Dachshund opened its mouth and swallowed the Russian dog with one bite. The Russian monster was gone!The Russian politicians, shaking their heads in disbelief, walked over to the cheering Americans and said: \"We don\u0091t understand how this could have happened. We had our best breeders working for five years with the meanest Doberman and Rottweiler breeds in the world and the biggest, meanest Siberian wolves!\"\"That's nothing,\" an American replied. \"We had our best plastic surgeons working for five years to make an alligator look like a Dachshund.\"",

Do not walk behind me, for I may not lead.Do not walk ahead of me, for Imay not follow.Do not walk beside me, either.Just leave me alone.3. If you don't like my driving, don't call anyone.Just take another road. That's why the highway department made so many of them.4. When I'm feeling down, I like to whistle. It makes the neighbor's dog run to the end of his chain and gag himself.5. It's always darkest before the dawn.So if you're going to steal the neighbor's newspaper, that's the time to do it.6. A handy telephone tip: Keep a small chalkboard near the phone. That way, when a salesman calls, you can hold the receiver up to it and run your fingernails across it until he hangs up.7. Each day I try to enjoy something from each of the four food groups the bonbon group, the salty-snack group, the caffeine group and the Whatever group.8. Into every life some rain must fall.Usually when your car windows are down.9. When you find yourself getting irritated with someone, try to remember that all men are brothers and just give them a noogie or an Indian burn. (try to avoid doing this to guys over 6'5\", because they can turn your body into an accordion Jershie :)10. This morning I woke up to the unmistakable scent of pigs in a blanket. That's the price you pay for letting your mother-in-law stay over.11. It's a small world.So you have to use your elbows a lot.12. Keep your nose to the grindstone and your shoulder to the wheel. It's a lot cheaper than plastic surgery.13. Love is like a roller coaster. When it's good you don't want to get off, and when it isn't, you can't wait to throw up.14. If you think nobody cares if you're alive, try missing a couple of car payments.15. If you lend someone $20, and never see that person again; it was probably worth it.",

        "body": "Letter from Camp...\nDear Mom & Dad:We are having a great time here at Lake Typhoid. Scoutmaster Webb is making us all write to our parents in case you saw the flood on TV and worried. We are OK. Only 1 of our tents and 2 sleeping bags got washed away. Luckily, none of us got drowned because we were all up on the mountain looking for Chad when it happened. Oh yes, please call Chad's mother and tell her he is OK. He can't write because of the cast. I got to ride in one of the search & rescue jeeps. It was neat. We never would have found him in the dark if it hadn't been for the lightning.Scoutmster Webb got mad at Chad for going on a hike alone without telling anyone. Chad said he did tell him, but it was during the fire so he probably didn't hear him. Did you know that if you put gas on a fire, the gas can will blow up? The wet wood still didn't burn, but one of our tents did. Also some of our clothes. John is going to look weird until his hair grows back. We will be home on Saturday if Scoutmaster Webb gets the car fixed. It wasn't his fault about the wreck. The brakes worked OK when we left. Scoutmaster Webb said that a car that old you have to expect something to break down; that's probably why he can't get insurance on it. We think it's a neat car. He doesn't care if we get it dirty, and if its hot, sometimes he lets us ride on the tailgate. It gets pretty hot with 10 people in a car. He let us take turns riding in the trailer until the highway patrolman stopped and talked to us. Scoutmaster Webb is a neat guy. Don't worry, he is a good driver.In fact, he is teaching Terry how to drive. But he only lets him drive on the mountain roads where there isn't any traffic. All we ever see up there are logging trucks. This morning all of the guys were diving off the rocks and swimming out in the lake. Scoutmaster Webb wouldn't let me because I can't swim and Chad was afraid he would sink because of his cast, so he let us take the canoe across the lake. It was great. You can still see some of the trees under the water from the flood.Scoutmaster Webb isn't crabby like some scoutmasters. He didn't even get mad about the life jackets. He has to spend a lot of time working on the car so we are trying not to cause him any trouble. Guess what? We have all passed our firstaid merit badges. When Dave dove in the lake and cut his arm, we got to see how a tourniquet works. Also Wade and I threw up. Scoutmaster Webb said it probably was just food poisoning from the leftover chicken. I have to go now. We are going into town to mail our letters and buy bullets. Don't worry about anything. We are fine.Love,ColeP.S. How long has it been since I had a tetanus shot?",

Jimmy is seven now and is a bright, handsome boy. He has developed quite an interest in the arts. He drew a family portrait for a school project, all the figures were good and the back of your head is very realistic. You should be very proud of him.Little Suzy turned three in September. She looks a lot like you did at that age. She is an attractive child and quite smart. She still remembers that you spent the whole afternoon with us on her birthday. What a grand day for Suzy, despite the fact that it was stormy and the electricity was out.I am doing well. I went blonde about a year ago and discovered that it really is more fun! Fred, I mean, Mr. Johnson the department head, has, uh, taken an interest in my career and has become a good friend to us all.I discovered that the household chores are much easier since I realized that you didn't mind being vacuumed but that feather dusting made you sneeze. The house is in good shape. I had the living room painted last spring. I'm sure you noticed it. I made sure that the painters cut holes in the drop sheet so you wouldn't be disturbed.Well, my dear, I must be going. Uncle Fred, uh, Mr. Johnson, I mean, is taking us all on a ski trip and there is packing to do. I have hired a housekeeper to take care of things while we are away, she'll keep things in order, fill your coffee cup and bring your meals to your desk, just the way you like it. I hope you and the computer will have a lovely time while we are gone. Jimmy, Suzy and I will think of you often. Try to remember us while your little disks are booting.Love,Your Wife",

It appeared that heaven was nothing more than a giant clock warehouse.Surprised at how heaven looked, the man asked St. Peter what the deal was. Why are all these clocks here in heaven? St Peter replied, the clocks keep track of things on earth. There is one clock for each person. Every time the person on earth tells a lie, his clock moves one minute. For instance, this clock is for Sam, the used car salesman. If you watch it closely, it will move. Click. The minute hand on Sam's clock moved one minute. Click. It moved another minute.Sam must be into closing a customer right now said St. Peter. The minute hand on his clock moves all day.The man and St Peter continued walking.

He makes $7,415/hr more than minimum wage. He'll make $3,710 while watching each episode of Friends. If he wanted to save up for a new Acura NSX ($90,000) it would take him a whole 12 hours. If someone were to hand him his salary and endorsement money, they would have to do it at the rate of $2.00 every second.

They advise people to wear noise-producing devices, such as little bells, on their clothing to alert but not startle the bears unexpectedly. They also advise you to carry pepper spray, in case of an encounter with a bear. It is also a good idea to watch for signs of bear activity. People should be able to recognize the difference between black bear and grizzly bear droppings. Black bear droppings are smaller and contain berries and possibly squirrel fur. Grizzly bear droppings have bells in them and smell like pepper spray.",

He, being a devoted husband, protested, but she argued and said she was going to take some aspirin and go to bed, and there was no need of his good time being spoiled by not going. So he took his costume and away he went. \nThe wife, after sleeping soundly for one hour, awakened without pain, and as it was still early, she decided to go to the party. In as much as her husband did not know what her costume was, she thought she would have some fun by watching her husband to see how he acted when she was not with him. She joined the party and soon spotted her husband cavorting around on the dance floor, dancing with every nice chick he could, and a little kiss here, a little kiss there and sometimes a little bit more. His wife sidled up to him and being a rather seductive woman herself, he left his partner high and dry and devoted his time to the new stuff that had just arrived. She let him go as far as he wished; naturally, since he was her husband. Finally he whispered a little proposition in her ear and she agreed, so off they went to one of the neighbouring rooms and did something which she would only allow her husband to do. She was quite upset afterwards because her husband could not know that she was his wife. She slipped away and went home and put the costume away and got into bed, wondering what kind of explanation he would make for his behaviour. She was sitting up reading when he came in and asked what kind of a time he had. He said, \"Oh, you know I never have a good time when you are not there.\" Then she asked, \"Did you dance much?\" He replied, \"I did not dance at all. When I got there I met Pete, Bill, John and some other guys, so we went into the den and played poker all evening. But the chap I lent my costume told me that he had a glorious evening.\"",

As the pastor stood beside the bed, Fred's frail condition grew worse, and he began to flail about as he tried to speak. Being unable to do so, he then motioned frantically for something to write on.\n\nThe priest, keeping watch at the side of his bed leaned quietly over and asked, \"Do you have something you would like to say?\" \n\nFred nodded to the affirmative, and the priest handed him a pad and pen. \"I know you can't speak, but use this to write a note, and I will give it to your wife. She's waiting just outside.\"\n\nGathering his last ounce of strength, Fred took them and scrawled his message upon the pad which he stuffed into the priest's hands. Then, moments later, he died.\n\nThe pastor thought it best not to look at the note just then, so he slipped it into his jacket pocket. After administering the last rites, the priest left to break the sad news to the wife.\n\nSeveral days later, at the funeral, the pastor delivered the eulogy. He realized that he was wearing the same jacket that he'd worn the day Fred died.\n\n\"You know,\" he said, \"Old Fred handed me a note just before he died. I haven't read it yet, but knowing Fred, I'm sure there's a word of inspiration there for us all.\" He unfolded the note and proceeded to read aloud,\n\n\"YOU'RE STANDING ON THE OXYGEN TUBE!!\"",

So he goes out and buys all the stuff for duck hunting. The man goes to a remote area and lays his fake ducks out on the pond nearby. He hides in the tall grass and pulls out his duck whistle and starts blowing. All of a sudden there are dozens of ducks flying by and he starts to shoot at them. He does this several times that day. At the end of the day he feels good about his new hobby and starts to look for all the ducks that he shot down. \n\nAfter collecting all the ducks the man heads back to his car and out of nowhere a park ranger appears and says to the man \"hello sir, how are you doing today?\" The man says proudly, with his chest sticking out \"I'm doing great!! It's my first time duck hunting and if you don't mind me saying it was a real challenge, I was even able to bag quite a few ducks today!\" \n\nThe ranger pauses and asks the man if he could see his duck hunting license. \"Sure no problem\" the man says. \"May I take a look at those ducks?\" the ranger says politely \"Sure, they're real beauties....help yourself\" replied the man. So the ranger puts on some gloves and takes out the first duck... he then proceeds to put his finger up the ducks butt. He looks at the man and says \"Hmmmm... this duck is from Montana\". The man is confused and thinks to himself that this ranger is weird. \n\n\nThe ranger asks the man if he has a tag for hunting ducks in Montana on his license. \"No\" the man says nervously. So the ranger says \"I'm sorry but I'm gonna have too give you a $1000 citation\". Upset and confused the man doesn't say anything, he's shocked. So the ranger takes another duck out of the man's bag and again sticks his finger up the ducks butt. \"Hmmmm... this duck is from Florida, do you have a tag for that?\" the ranger says to the man. \n\nThe man turns furiously red and replies \"NO!\" \"Well I guess I'm afraid that's another $1000 citation that I have to issue you.\" the ranger replies. By this time the man is completely baffled and has never heard such bullcrap before. The ranger finally takes the last duck out of the bag and puts his finger up the ducks butt. \"Hmmm... this duck is from Colorado, I suppose you don't have a tag for that either?\" the ranger says to the man. \n\"NOOOO\", shouts the man. \"Well I guess I'm gonna have to give you three citations today sir.\" replies the ranger. As the ranger pulls out his ticket book and starts writing the man's citation, he says to the man, \"You must be new to this area, where are you from?\" The man, steaming mad, pulls his pants down and shouts....\"WHY DON'T YOU PUT YOUR FINGER UP MY BUTT AND FIND OUT!!!\"",

The tribe puts him on trial for crimes against the Indian Nation, and he is found guilty. \"You have been sentenced to death,\" said the Chief, \"but, as is our custom, you have three wishes to make as your last requests.\" The cowboy thought for a minute and said, \"Well, for my first wish, I'll need my horse.\" \"Give him his horse,\" said the Chief. The cowboy whispered something into the horse's ear, and the horse took off like a shot across the prairie. Twenty minutes later, the horse returned with a beautiful blonde woman on its back. The cowboy looked at this, shrugged his shoulders, and helped the young lady off the horse. He then took her into the woods and had his way with her. \"Second wish,\" said the Chief. \"I'll need my horse again,\" said the cowboy. \"Give him his horse,\" said the Chief. Once again, the cowboy whispered into the horse's ear, and once again the horse rode off over the prairie. Thirty minutes later, the horse returned with a beautiful brunette on its back. The cowboy looked up and shrugged, helped the young lady off the horse, and went into the woods, same reason as before. \"This is your last wish,\" said the Chief, \"make it a good one.\" \"I'll need my horse again.\" \"Give him his horse,\" said the Chief. The cowboy grabbed each side of the horse's head, and put his face right up to the horse's. \"You stupid horse, I said POSSE!\"",

They immediately impounded the aircraft and hauled the pilot into an interrogation room.\n\nThe pilot's story was that he took off from Vegas, got lost, and spotted the Base just as he was about to run out of fuel. The Air Force started a full FBI background check on the pilot and held him overnight during the investigation.\n\nBy the next day, they were finally convinced that the pilot really was lost and wasn't a spy. They gassed up his airplane, gave him a terrifying \"you-did-not-see-a-base\" briefing, complete with threats of spending the rest of his life in prison, told him Vegas was that-a-way on such-and-such a heading, and sent him on his way.\n\nThe day after that though, to the total disbelief of the Air Force, the same Cessna showed up again. Once again, the MP's surrounded the plane...only this time there were two people in the plane.\n\nThe same pilot jumped out and said, \"Do anything you want to me, but my wife is in the plane and you have to tell her where I was last night!\"",

She comes up on this trucker who is carrying a double-wide home and is taking up both lanes. To her disliking, he is only going about 45. To get the point across that she wants to get past, she decides to tailgate him. So, she gets to within a foot of his rear bumper. The trucker looks back and sees her on his ass, and motions for her to get off of it, but to her it looks like a wave and she waves back. Since her first attempt was futile, she decided to get a little closer and begin flashing her headlights, hopefully making herself more visible in the process. Once again the trucker sees her on his ass, and this time motions for her to pull over to the side of the road. The trucker steps out of his vehicle with a chunk of chalk and draws a circle three feet in diameter in the middle of the road. He instructs her not to move until he tells her to. Naive as she was, she agrees to it and steps inside it. The trucker goes back to his truck and pulls out a 50-ounce Louisville Slugger. He walks over to the Lamborghini and beats it, and beats it, and beats it again. When he is done, all that is left is a brand new, candy-apple red, $125,000 pile of metal. Satisfied, he throws the bat in his truck and walks over to the blonde. When he gets there, to his astonishment, she is rolling around on the street laughing hysterically. He asks her, \"Why are you laughing? I just beat the crap out of your car!!\" She is laughing too hard to respond, but between giggles he can make out, \"While you weren't looking I stepped out of the circle twice!\"",

In April he received another and threw that one away too. The following month the credit card company sent him a very nasty note stating they were going to cancel his card if he didn't send them $0.00 by return of post. He called them, talked to them, they said it was a computer error and told him they'd take care of it. The following month he decided that it was about time that he tried out the troublesome credit card figuring that if there were purchases on his account it would put an end to his ridiculous predicament. However, in the first store that he produced his credit card in payment for his purchases he found that his card had been canceled. He called the credit card company who apologized for the computer error once again and said that they would take care of it. The next day he got a bill for $0.00 stating that payment was now overdue. Assuming that having spoken to the credit card company only the previous day the latest bill was yet another mistake he ignored it, trusting that the company would be as good as their word and sort the problem out. The next month he got a bill for $0.00 stating that he had 10 days to pay his account or the company would have to take steps to recover the debt. Finally giving in, he thought he would play the company at their own game and mailed them a check for $0.00. The computer duly processed his account and returned a statement to the effect that he now owed the credit card company nothing at all. A week later, the man's bank called him asking him what he was doing writing a check for $0.00. After a lengthy explanation the bank replied that the $0.00 check had caused their check processing software to fail. The bank could not now process ANY checks from ANY of their customers that day because the check for $0.00 was causing the computer to crash. The following month the man received a letter from the credit card company claiming that his check had bounced and that he now owed them $0.00 and unless he sent a check by return of post they would be taking steps to recover the debt. The man, who had been considering buying his wife a computer for her birthday, bought her a typewriter instead.",

This catches the blonde's attention and, figuring that there will be no end to this torment unless she plays, she agrees to the game. The lawyer asks the first question: \"What's the distance from the earth to the moon?\" The blonde doesn't say a word, reaches into her purse, pulls out a five-dollar bill and hands it to the lawyer. Now, it's the blonde's turn. She asks the lawyer: \"What goes up a hill with three legs, and comes down with four?\" The lawyer looks at her with a puzzled look.

The blonde politely takes the $50 and turns away to get back to sleep. The lawyer, who is more than a little miffed, wakes the blonde and asks, \"Well, so what IS the answer?\" Without a word, the blonde reaches into her purse, hands the lawyer $5, and goes back to sleep.",

After the burial, as the three are walking away together, the doctor turns to the other two and says, \"-Friends, I have a confession to make. As you know, at the hospital we are desperate because of the cutbacks in funding. Our CAT SCAN machine broke down and we haven't be able to get a new one. So, I took $20,000 of our friend's money for a new CAT SCAN and put the rest in the coffin as he asked.-\" At this the priest says, \"-I, too have a confession to make. As you know, our church is simply overwhelmed by the problem of the homeless. The needs keep increasing and we have nowhere to turn. So I took $50,000 from the envelope for our homeless fund and put the rest in the coffin as our friend requested.-\" Fixing the other two in his gaze, the lawyer says \"-I am astonished and deeply disappointed that you would treat so casually our solemn undertaking to our friend. I want you to know that I placed in his coffin my personal check for the full one hundred thousand dollars.-\"",

He would have a religious debate with a member of the Jewish community. If the Jew won, the Jews could stay. If the Pope won, the Jews would leave. The Jews realized that they had no choice. So they picked a middle aged man named Moishe to represent them. Moishe asked for one addition to the debate. To make it more interesting, neither side would be allowed to talk. The Pope agreed. The day of the great debate came. Moishe and the Pope sat opposite each other for a full minute before the Pope raised his hand and showed three fingers. Moishe looked back at him and raised one finger. The Pope waved his fingers in a circle around his head. Moishe pointed to the ground where he sat. The Pope pulled out a wafer and a glass of wine. Moishe pulled out an apple. The Pope stood up and said, \"I give up. This man is too good. The Jews can stay.\" An hour later, the cardinals were all around the Pope asking him what had happened. The Pope said, \"First I held up three fingers to represent the Trinity. He responded by holding up one finger to remind me that there was still one God common to both our religions. Then I waved my finger around me to show him that God was all around us. He responded by pointing to the ground and showing that God was also right here with us. I pulled out the wine and wafer to show that God absolves us from our sins. He pulled out an apple to remind me of original sin. He had an answer for everything. What could I do?\" Meanwhile, the Jewish community had crowded around Moishe. \"What happened?\" they asked. \"Well,\" said Moishe, \"First he said to me that the Jews had three days to get out of here. I told him that not one of us was leaving. Then he told me that this whole city would be cleared of Jews. I let him know that we were staying right here.\" \"Yes, yes,.. and then???\" asked the crowd. \"I don't know,\" said Moishe, \"He took out his lunch, and I took out mine.\"",

As he approaches the bar, he sees a big sign on the door that says, \"COMPUTER NERDS NOT ALLOWED - ENTER AT YOUR OWN RISK!\" He enters and sits down.\n\nThe bartender comes over to him, sniffs, and says that he smells kind of nerdy. He then asks him what he does for a living. The truck driver explains to him that he drives a truck, and the smell is just from the computers he is hauling. The bartender serves him a beer and says, \"OK, truck drivers aren't nerds.\"\n\nAs he is sipping his beer, a skinny guy walks in wearing a pair of glasses with tape around the middle, a pocket protector with twelve kinds of pens and pencils, and a belt that is at least a foot too long. The bartender, without saying a word, pulls out a shotgun and blows the guy away. The truck driver asks him why he did that.\n\nThe bartender replied, \"Don't worry. The computer nerds are in season because they are overpopulating Silicon Valley. You don't even need a license.\"\n\nSo the truck driver finishes his beer, gets back in his truck, and heads for the freeway. Suddenly, he veers to avoid an accident, and the load shifts. The back door breaks open and computers spill out all over the road. He jumps out and sees a crowd already forming, snatching up all of the computers. The scavengers are comprised of engineers, accountants and programmers - computer geeks. Each of them wearing the nerdiest clothes he has ever seen.\n\nHe can't let them steal his whole load. So remembering what happened in the bar, he pulls out his gun and starts blasting away, killing several of them instantly. A highway patrol officer comes zooming up and jumps out of the car screaming at him to stop.\n\nThe truck driver said, \"What's wrong? I thought computer nerds were in season.\"\n\n\"Well, sure,\" says the patrolman, \"But you can't bait 'em!\"",

You are able to argue persuasively that Ross Perot's phrase \"electronic town hall\" makes more sense than the term \"information superhighway,\" but you don't because, after all, the man still uses hand drawn pie charts.\n\n19. You go to computer trade shows and map out your path of the exhibit hall in advance. But you cannot give someone directions to your house without looking up the street names.\n\n20. You would rather get more dots per inch than miles per gallon.\n\n21. You become upset when a person calls you on the phone to sell you something, but you think it's okay for a computer to call and demand that you start pushing buttons on your telephone to receive more information about the product it is selling.\n\n22. You know without a doubt that disks come in five and a quarter and three and a half inch sizes.\n\n23. Al Gore strikes you as an \"intriguing\" fellow.\n\n24.

If so, my friend, technology has taken over your life. We suggest, for your own good, that you go lie under a tree and write a haiku. And don't use a laptop.\n\n31. You email these jokes to your friends over the net. You'd never get around to showing it to them in person or reading it to them on the phone.

The following is an open letter to Dr. Laura penned by a east coast resident, which was posted on the Internet.\n\nDear Dr. Laura:\n\nThank you for doing so much to educate people regarding God's Law.\n\nI have learned a great deal from your show, and try to share that knowledge with as many people as I can. When someone tries to defend the homosexual lifestyle, for example, I simply remind them that Leviticus 18:22 clearly states it to be an abomination. End of debate.\n\nI do need some advice from you, however, regarding some of the other specific laws and how to follow them:\n\nWhen I burn a bull on the altar as a sacrifice, I know it creates a pleasing odor for the Lord - Lev.1:9. The problem is my neighbors. They claim the odor is not pleasing to them. Should I smite them?\n\nI would like to sell my daughter into slavery, as sanctioned in Exodus 21:7. In this day and age, what do you think would be a fair price for her?\n\nI know that I am allowed no contact with a woman while she is in her period of menstrual unseemliness - Lev.15:19- 24. The problem is, how do I tell? I have tried asking, but most women take offense.\n\nLev. 25:44 states that I may indeed possess slaves, both male and female, provided they are purchased from neighboring nations. A friend of mine claims that this applies to Mexicans, but not Canadians. Can you clarify? Why can't I own Canadians?\n\nI have a neighbor who insists on working on the Sabbath. Exodus 35:2 clearly states he should be put to death. Am I morally obligated to kill him myself?\n\nA friend of mine feels that even though eating shellfish is an abomination - Lev. 11:10, it is a lesser abomination than homosexuality. I don't agree. Can you settle this?\n\nLev. 21:20 states that I may not approach the altar of God if I have a defect in my sight. I have to admit that I wear reading glasses. Does my vision have to be 20/20, or is there some wiggle room here?\n\nMost of my male friends get their hair trimmed, including the hair around their temples, even though this is expressly forbidden by Lev. 19:27. How should they die?\n\nI know from Lev. 11:6-8 that touching the skin of a dead pig makes me unclean, but may I still play football if I wear gloves?\n\nMy uncle has a farm. He violates Lev. 19 by planting two different crops in the same field, as does his wife by wearing garments made of two different kinds of thread (cotton/polyester blend). He also tends to curse and blaspheme a lot. Is it really necessary that we go to all the trouble of getting the whole town together to stone them? - Lev.24:10-16. Couldn't we just burn them to death at a private family affair like we do with people who sleep with their in-laws? (Lev. 20:14)\n\nI know you have studied these things extensively, so I am confident you can help. Thank you again for reminding us that God's word is eternal and unchanging.\n\nYour devoted fan,\n\n\"East Coast Resident\"",

Inside the small boat were several large yellow fin tuna. The American complimented the Mexican on the quality of his fish and asked how long it took to catch them. \n\nThe Mexican replied, \"Only a little while.\" The American then asked, \"Why didn't you stay out longer and catch more fish?\" The Mexican said, \"With this I have more than enough to support my family's needs.\" The American then asked, \"But what do you do with the rest of your time?\" \n\nThe Mexican fisherman said, \"I sleep late, fish a little, play with my children, take siesta with my wife, Maria, stroll into the village each evening where I sip wine and play guitar with my amigos, I have a full and busy life.\"\n\nThe American scoffed, \"I am a Harvard MBA and could help you. You should spend more time fishing; and with the proceeds, buy a bigger boat: With the proceeds from the bigger boat you could buy several boats. Eventually you would have a fleet of fishing boats. Instead of selling your catch to a middleman you would sell directly to the processor; Eventually opening your own cannery. You would control the product, processing and distribution. You would need to leave this small coastal fishing village and move to Mexico City, then Los Angeles and eventually New York where you will run your ever-expanding enterprise.\"\n\nThe Mexican fisherman asked, \"But, how long will this all take?\" To which the American replied, \"15 to 20 years.\" \"But what then?\" asked the Mexican. The American laughed and said that's the best part. \"When the time is right you would announce an IPO and sell your company stock to the public and become very rich, you would make millions.\" \n\n\"Millions?...Then what?\" The American said, \"Then you would retire. Move to a small coastal fishing village where you would sleep late, fish a little, play with your kids, take siesta with your wife, stroll to the village in the evenings where you could sip wine and play your guitar with your amigos.\"",

I simply mentioned that\nI had sustained a head injury and I hoped I would feel up to coming in\nthe next day. By then, I could think up a doozy to explain the bandage\non my crown.\n\nIn this case, the truth hurt. I mean it really hurt in\nthe place men feel the most pain. The accident occurred mainly because\nI conceded to my wife's wishes to adopt a cute little kitty\n\nAs the daily routine prescribes, I was taking my shower\nafter breakfast when I heard my wife, Deb, call out to me from the kitchen.\n\"Ed!\" she harkened. \"The garbage disposal is dead. Come reset it.\" \"You\nknow where the button is.\" I protested through the shower (pitter-patter).\n\n\"Reset it yourself!\"\n\n\"I am scared!\" She pleaded. \"What if it starts going and\nsucks me in?\"\n\nPause. \"C'mon, it'll only take a second.\" No logical assurance\nabout how a disposal can't start itself will calm the fears of a person\nwho suffers from \"Big-ol-scary-machine-phobia,\" a condition brought on\nby watching too many Stephen King movies.\n\nIt is futile to argue or explain, kind of like telling\nLloyd Bentsen Americans are over-taxed. And if a poltergeist did, in fact,\npossess the disposal, and she was ground into round, I'd have to live with\nthat the rest of my life.\n\nSo out I came, dripping wet and buck naked, hoping to\nmake a statement about how her cowardly behavior was, not without consequence,\nbut it was I who would suffer. I crouched down and stuck my head under\nthe sink to find the button.\n\nIt is the last action I remember performing. It struck\nwithout warning, without respect to my circumstances. Nay, it wasn't a\nhexed disposal, drawing me into its gnashing metal teeth. It was our new\nkitty, clawing playfully at the dangling objects she spied between my legs.\nShe (\"Buttons\" aka \"the Grater\") had been poised around the corner and\nstalked me as I took the bait under the sink. At precisely the second I\nwas most vulnerable, she leapt at the toys I unwittingly offered and snagged\nthem with her needle-like claws.\n\nNow when men feel pain or even sense danger anywhere close\nto their masculine region, they lose all rational thought to control orderly\nbodily movements.

Not even a\nwell trained monk could calmly stand with his groin supporting the full\nweight of a kitten and rectify the situation in a step-by-step procedure.\nWild animals are sometimes faced with a \"fight or flight\" syndrome; men,\nin this predicament, choose only the \"flight\" option.\n\nFleeing straight up, I knew at that moment how a cat feels\nwhen it is alarmed. It was a dismal irony. But, whereas cats seek great\nheights to escape, I never made it that far. The sink and cabinet bluntly\nimpeded my ascent; the impact knocked me out cold.\n\nWhen I awoke, my wife and the paramedics stood over me.\nHaving been fully briefed by my wife, the paramedics snorted as they tried\nto conduct their work while suppressing their hysterical laughter. My wife\ntold me I should be flattered.\n\nAt the office, colleagues tried to coax an explanation\nout of me. I kept silent, claiming it was too painful to talk. \"What's\nthe matter, cat got your tongue?\"\n\nIf they had only known.",

A few low but loud growls will help you feel charged up.\n\nNow it is time to add some eye-paw coordination work. Find a marble (the big steelies work even better) and roll that down the floor as the sprints continue. See how many times you can ricochet it off the wallboards before it disappears under the fridge. Finally, work on that upper body strength. Climbing is a great exercise. Use draperies, macram\u00e9 plant hangers, or clothing on hangers. You can even find some carpeting on some basement walls. Backs of chairs work well, too.\n\nNow put it all together. A speed sprint to the end of the hall! A race around the living room! Leap to the back of the rocking chair! Let the rebound launch you to the top of the swinging planter! Rock that baby! Feel those muscles work. Just as the hook pulls loose from the ceiling, dash to the bedroom and dive under the covers. Establish your alibi just in time to hear the crash of the plant to the floor below.\n\nHave a good Work-Out!",

Like most blind\nbelievers, I've been able to discount all the facts to the contrary - the\nkitty odors that lurk in the corners of the garage and dirt smudges that\ncling to the throw rug by the fireplace.\n\nThe time comes, however, when a man must face reality; when he must\nlook squarely in the face of massive public sentiment to the contrary and\nannounce: \"This cat smells like a port-a-potty on a hot day in Juarez.\"\n\nWhen that day arrives at your house, as it has in mine, I have some\nadvice you might consider as you place your feline friend under you arm\nand head for the bathtub:\n\n* Know that although the cat has the advantage of quickness and lack\nof concern for human life, you have the advantage of strength. Capitalize\non that advantage by selecting the battlefield. Don't try to bathe him\nin an open area where he can force you to chase him. Pick a very small\nbathroom. If your bathroom is more than four feet square, I recommend that\nyou get in the tub with the cat and close the sliding-glass doors as if\nyou were about to take a shower. (A simple shower curtain will not do.\nA berserk cat can shred a three-ply rubber shower curtain quicker than\na politician can shift positions.)\n\n* Know that a cat has claws and will not hesitate to remove all the\nskin from your body. Your advantage here is that you are smart and know\nhow to dress to protect yourself. I recommend canvas overalls tucked into\nhigh-top construction boots, a pair of steel-mesh gloves, an army helmet,\na hockey face mask and a long-sleeve flak jacket.\n\n* Prepare everything in advance. There is no time to go out for a towel\nwhen you have a cat digging a hole in your flak jacket. Draw the water.\nMake sure the bottle of kitty shampoo is inside the glass enclosure. Make\nsure the towel can be reached, even if you are lying on your back in the\nwater.\n\n* Use the element of surprise. Pick up your cat nonchalantly, as if\nto simply carry him to his supper dish. (Cats will not usually notice your\nstrange attire. They have little or no interest in fashion as a rule. If\nhe does notice your garb, calmly explain that you are taking part in a\nproduct- testing experiment for J.C. Penney.)\n\n* Once you are inside the bathroom, speed is essential to survival.\nIn a single liquid motion, shut the bathroom door, step into the tub enclosure,\nslide the glass door shut, dip the cat in the water and squirt him with\nshampoo. You have begun one of the wildest 45 seconds of your life. Cats\nhave no handles. Add the fact that he now has soapy fur, and the problem\nis radically compounded. Do not expect to hold on to him for more that\ntwo or three seconds at a time. When you have him, however, you must remember\nto give him another squirt of shampoo and rub like crazy. He'll then spring\nfree and fall back into the water, thereby rinsing himself off. (The national\nrecord is - for cats - three latherings, so don't expect too much.)\n\n* Next, the cat must be dried. Novice cat bathers always assume this\npart will be the most difficult, for humans generally are worn out at this\npoint and the cat is just getting really determined. In fact, the drying\nis simple compared to what you have just been through. That's because by\nnow the cat is semi-permanently affixed to your right leg. You simply pop\nthe drain plug with your foot, reach for your towel and wait. (Occasionally,\nhowever, the cat will end up clinging to the top of your army helmet. If\nthis happens, the best thing you can do is to shake him loose and to encourage\nhim toward your leg.) After all the water is drained from the tub, it is\na simple matter to just reach down and dry the cat.\n\nIn a few days the cat will relax enough to be removed from your leg.\nHe will usually have nothing to say for about three weeks and will spend\na lot of time sitting with his back to you. He might even become psychoceramic\nand develop the fixed stare of a plaster figurine.\n\nYou will be tempted to assume he is angry. This isn't usually the case.\nAs a rule he is simply plotting ways to get through your defenses and injure\nyou for life the next time you decide to give him a bath. But, at least\nnow he smells a lot better",

        "body": "** DOORS:\n\nDo not allow closed doors in any room. To get door opened, stand on\nhind legs and hammer with forepaws. Once door is opened, it is not necessary\nto use it. After you have ordered an \"outside\" door opened, stand halfway\nin and out and think about several things. This is particularly important\nduring very cold weather, rain, snow, or mosquito season. Swinging doors\nare to be avoided at all costs.\n\n** CHAIRS and RUGS:\n\nIf you have to throw up, get to a chair quickly. If you cannot manage\nin time, get to an Oriental rug. If there is no Oriental rug, shag is good.\nWhen throwing up on the carpet, make sure you back up so that it is as\nlong as the human's bare foot.\n\n** BATHROOMS:\n\nAlways accompany guests to the bathroom. It is not necessary to do anything\n-- just sit and stare.\n\n** HAMPERING:\n\nIf one of your humans is engaged in some close activity and the other\nis idle, stay with the busy one. This is called \"helping\", otherwise known\nas \"hampering.\" Following are the rules for \"hampering\":\n\na) When supervising cooking, sit just behind the left heel of the cook.\nYou cannot be seen and thereby stand a better chance of being stepped on\nand then picked up and comforted.\n\nb) For book readers, get in close under the chin, between eyes and book,\nunless you can lie across the book itself.\n\nc) For knitting projects or paperwork, lie on the work in the most appropriate\nmanner so as to obscure as much of the work or at least the most important\npart. Pretend to doze, but every so often reach out and slap the pencil\nor knitting needles. The worker may try to distract you; ignore it. Remember,\nthe aim is to hamper work.\n\nEmbroidery and needlepoint projects make great hammocks in spite of\nwhat the humans may tell you.\n\nd) For people paying bills (monthly activity) or working on income taxes\nor Christmas cards (annual activity), keep in mind the aim -- to hamper!\nFirst, sit on the paper being worked on. When dislodged, watch sadly from\nthe side of the table. When activity proceeds nicely, roll around on the\npapers, scattering them to the best of your ability. After being removed\nfor the second time, push pens, pencils, and erasers off the table, one\nat a time.\n\ne) When a human is holding the newspaper in front of him/her, be sure\nto jump on the back of the paper. They love to jump.\n\n** WALKING:\n\nAs often as possible, dart quickly and as close as possible in front\nof the human, especially: on stairs, when they have something in their\narms, in the dark, and when they first get up in the morning. This will\nhelp their coordination skills.\n\n** BEDTIME:\n\nAlways sleep on the human at night so s/he cannot move round.\n\n** PLAY:\n\nThis is an important part of your life. Get enough sleep in the daytime\nso you are fresh for your nocturnal games. Below are listed several favorite\ncat games that you can play. It is important though to maintain one's Dignity\nat all times. If you should have an accident during play, such as falling\noff a chair, immediately wash a part of your body as if to say \"I MEANT\nto do that!\" It fools those humans every time.\n\nCAT GAMES:\n\n\"Catch Mouse\":\n\nThe humans would have you believe that those lumps under the covers\nare their feet and hands. They are lying. They are actually Bed Mice, rumored\nto be the most delicious of all the mice in the world, though no cat has\never been able to catch one. Rumor also has it that only the most ferocious\nattack can stun them long enough for you to dive under the covers to get\nthem. Maybe YOU can be the first to taste the Bed Mouse!\n\n\"King of the Hill\":\n\nThis game must be played with at least one other cat. The more, the\nmerrier! One or both of the sleeping humans is Hill 303 which must be defended\nat all costs from the other cat(s). Anything goes. This game allows for\nthe development of unusual tactics as one must take the unstable playing\ntheater into account.\n\nWARNING:\n\nPlaying either of these games to excess will result in expulsion from\nthe bed and possibly from the bedroom. Should the humans grow restless,\nimmediately begin purring and cuddle up to them.\n\nThis should buy you some time until they fall asleep again. If one happens\nto be on a human when this occurs, this cat wins the round of King of the\nHill.\n\n** TOYS:\n\nAny small item is a potential toy. If a human tries to confiscate it,\nthis means that it is a Good Toy. Run with it under the bed. Look suitably\noutraged when the human grabs you and takes it away.\n\nAlways watch where it is put so you can steal it later. Two reliable\nsources of toys are dresser tops and wastebaskets. There are several types\nof cat toys.\n\nBright shiny things like keys, brooches, or coins should be hidden so\nthat the other cat(s) or humans can't play with them. They are generally\ngood for playing hockey with on uncarpeted floors.\n\nDangly and/or string-like things such as shoelaces, cords, gold chains,\nand dental floss also make excellent toys. They are favorites of humans\nwho like to drag them across the floor for us to pounce on. When a string\nis dragged under a newspaper or throw rug, it magically becomes the Paper/Rug\nMouse and should be killed at all costs. Take care, though. Humans are\nsneaky and will try to make you lose your Dignity.\n\n** PAPER BAGS:\n\nWithin paper bags dwell the Bag Mice. They are small and camouflaged\nto be the same color as the bag, so they are hard to see. But you can easily\nhear the crinkling noises they make as they scurry around the bag. Anything,\nup to and including shredding the bag, can be done to kill them. Note:\nany other cat you may find in a bag hunting for Bag Mice is fair game for\na Sneak Attack, which will usually result in a great Tag match.\n\n** FOOD:\n\nIn order to get the energy to sleep, play, and hamper, a cat must eat.\nEating, however, is only half the fun. The other half is getting the food.\nCats have two ways to obtain food: convincing a human you are starving\nto death and must be fed *NOW*; and hunting for it oneself.\n\nThe following are guidelines for getting fed.\n\na) When the humans are eating, make sure you leave the tip of your tail\nin their dishes when they are not looking.\n\nb) Never eat food from your own bowl if you can steal some from the\ntable.\n\nc) Never drink from your own water bowl if a human's glass is full enough\nto drink from.\n\nd) Should you catch something of your own outside, it is only polite\nto attempt to get to know it. Be insistent -- your food will usually not\nbe so polite and try to leave.\n\ne) Table scraps are delicacies with which the humans are unfortunately\nunwilling to readily part. It is beneath the Dignity of a cat to beg outright\nfor food as lower forms of life such as dogs will, but several techniques\nexist for ensuring that the humans don't forget you exist. These include,\nbut are not limited to: jumping onto the lap of the \"softest\" human and\npurring loudly; lying down in the doorway between the dining room and the\nkitchen, the Direct Stare, and twining around people's legs as they sit\nand eat while meowing plaintively.\n\n** SLEEPING:\n\nAs mentioned above, in order to have enough energy for playing, a cat\nmust get plenty of sleep. It is generally not difficult to find comfortable\nplace to curl up. Any place a human likes to sit is good, especially if\nit contrasts with your fur color. If it's in a sunbeam or near a heating\nduct or radiator, so much the better. Of course, good places also exist\noutdoors, but have the disadvantages of being seasonal and dependent on\ncurrent and previous weather conditions such as rain. Open windows are\na good compromise.\n\n** SCRATCHING POSTS:\n\nIt is advised that cats use any scratching post the humans may provide.\nThey are very protective of what they think is their property and will\nobject strongly if they catch you sharpening your claws on it. Being sneaky\nand doing it when they aren't around won't help, as they are very observant.\nIf you are an outdoor kitty, trees are good. Sharpening your claws on a\nhuman is a definite no-no!\n\n** HUMANS:\n\nHumans have three primary functions: to feed us, to play with and give\nattention to us, and to clean the litter box. It is important to maintain\none's Dignity when around humans so that they will not forget who is the\nmaster of the house. Humans need to know basic rules. They can be taught\nif you start early and are consistent.\n\nYou will then have a smooth-running household.",

        "body": "Dear Sir,\n\nI've been having some conflicts between programs lately. I've been running\nthe original version of DrinkingBuddies 1.0 as my primary application and\nall the GirlFriend releases I've tried have always conflicted with it.\nI hear that DrinkingBuddies won't crash if GirlFriend is run in background\nmode and the sound is turned off. But I'm embarrassed to say I can't find\nthe switch to turn the sound off. I just run them separately and it works\nokay. GirlFriend also seems to have a problem co-existing with my Golf\nprogram, often trying to abort Golf with some sort of timing incompatibility.\n\nI probably should have stayed with GirlFriend 1.0, but I thought I might\nsee better performance from GirlFriend 2.0. After months of conflicts and\nother problems, I consulted a friend who has had experience with GirlFriend\n2.0. He said I probably didn't have enough cache to run GirlFriend 2.0,\nand eventually it would require a Token Ring to run properly. He was right\n- as soon as I purged my cache, it uninstalled itself. Shortly after that,\nI installed GirlFriend 3.0 beta. All the bugs were supposed to be gone\nbut the first time I used it, it gave me a virus. I had to clean out my\nwhole system and shut down for a while. I very cautiously upgraded to GirlFriend\n4.0. This time I used a SCSI probe first and also installed a virus protection\nprogram. It worked okay for a while until I discovered that GirlFriend\n1.0 was still in my system. I tried running GirlFriend 1.0 again with GirlFriend\n4.0 still installed, but GirlFriend 4.0 has a feature I didn't know about\nthat automatically senses the presence of any other version of GirlFriend\nand communicates with it in some way, which results in the immediate removal\nof both versions. The version I have now works pretty well, but there are\nstill some problems.\n\nLike all versions of GirlFriend, it is written in some obscure language\nI can't understand, much less reprogram. Frankly, I think there is too\nmuch attention paid to the look and feel rather than the desired functionality.\nAlso, to get the best connections with your hardware, you usually have\nto use gold-plated contacts. And I've never liked how GirlFriend is totally\nobject-oriented.\n\nA year ago, a friend of mine upgraded his version of GirlFriend to GirlFriendPlus\n1.0, which is a Terminate and Stay Resident version of GirlFriend. He discovered\nthat GirlFriendPlus 1.0 expires within a year if you don't upgrade to Fianc\u00e9\n1.0. So he did, but soon after that, he had to upgrade to Wife 1.0, which\nhe describes as a huge resource hog. It has taken up all his space so he\ncan't load anything else. One of the primary reasons he decided to go with\nWife 1.0 was because it came bundled with FreeSexPlus. Well, it turns out\nthat the resource allocation module of Wife 1.0 sometimes prohibits access\nto FreeSexPlus, particularly the new Plug-Ins he wanted to try. On top\nof that, Wife 1.0 must be running on a well warmed-up system before he\ncan do anything.\n\nAlthough he did not ask for it, Wife 1.0 also came with MotherInLaw\n1.0 which has an automatic pop-up feature he can't turn off. I told him\nto try installing Mistress 1.0, but he said he'd heard that if you try\nto run it without first uninstalling Wife 1.0, Wife 1.0 will delete MSMoney\nfiles before doing the uninstall itself. Then, Mistress 1.0 won't install\nanyway because of insufficient resources.",

        "body": "In the beginning, there was chaos and the Universe was without form\nand void. The Lord looked upon His domain and decided to declare His presence.\n\"I be\" he said, then to correct his grammar added \"am.\" If the Lord had\ndecided to work on irregular verb conjugation first, this wouldn't have\nhappened. God would later curse the English language for its part, but\nin that moment IBM came into being. The Lord looked out upon the IBM He\nhad created and said \"This is good.\" That's what He said, but He shook\nhis head, wondered what the boys at the User Group would say, split the\nlight from the dark and went to bed. Thus passed the Beginning and the\nend of the first day.\n\nOn the second day, the Lord summoned IBM unto His presence. \"There is\nchaos out there, and the Universe is without form and void. I must correct\nthis and I can use your help. Is there anything you can do for me?\"\n\n\"I can take care of form,\" IBM replied. \"Put me in charge of computers\nand I will take care of form for you.\"\n\nThe Lord thought that this was good and said \"Let there be computers.\nLet IBM have my powers of creation that pertain to computers and form.\"\nThus saying, the Lord went off to His second day's work while IBM created\nthe 1401.\n\nOn the third day, while the Lord was out, IBM decided to subdivide the\nassgined task. \"Let there be systems that make the computer work and let\nthem be called Operating Systems. Let there also be systems that make use\nof the computer and let them be called Application Systems.\" Thus, there\ncame into being both Operating Systems and Application Systems, but there\nwere no programmers.\n\nThe next morning IBM had to give the Lord a status report.\n\n\"What did you do yesterday?\" the Lord asked.\n\n\"I invented the operating system\" IBM replied.\n\n\"You did?\" the Lord shuddered. \"Oh dear.\"\n\n\"Yes I did,\" IBM confirmed, \"but I find I need something you alone can\nprovide.\"\n\n\"And what is that?\"\n\n\"I need programmers to use my computers, to operate my operating system\nand to apply my applications.\"\n\n\"That can't be done now,\" said the Lord. \"This is only the fourth day\nand there won't be people until the sixth day.\"\n\n\"I need programmers and I need them now. If they can't be people they\ncan't be people, but we have to work this out today.\"\n\n\"Give me some specifications and I'll see what I can do.\" IBM hastily\nworked up specs for programmers (are specs ever anything other than hasty)\nand the Lord reviewed them. The Lord knew the specs weren't sufficient\nbut followed them anyway. He also made some programmers that did just what\nprogrammers were supposed to do, just to spite IBM. The programmers and\nIBM spent the rest of the day creating the Assembler and FORTRAN. On the\nmorning of the fifth day, IBM reported to the Lord once again.\n\n\"The programmers you created for me have a problem. They want a programming\nlanguage that is easy to use and similar to English. I told them you had\ncursed English, though I still don't know why. They wanted me to ask your\nindulgence on this.\"\n\nThe Lord had cursed English for good reason, but didn't want to explain\nthis to IBM. He said \"let there be COBOL\" and that was that.\n\nOn the status report of the next day IBM announced that computers had\ngone forth and multiplied. Unfortunately, the computers still weren't big\nenough or fast enough to do what the programmers wanted. The Lord liked\nthe idea of going forth multiplying, and used the line Himself later on\nthat day. This sixth day being particularly busy, He declared \"Let there\nbe MVS\" and there was MVS.\n\nOn the seventh day God had finished creation and computers had COBOL\nand MVS. The Lord and IBM took the day off to go fishing. IBM hung a sign\non the door to help programmers in his absence.\n\n\nOn the start of the second week the programmers went over IBM's cathode\nray tube directly to God. \"We have a horrible problem,\" they complained.\n\"Our users want systems that perform according to their expectations.\"\n\n\"USERS!\" the Lord bellowed. \"Who said that you should have users! Users\nare the difference between good and bad applications, a function I have\nreserved unto myself! Who authorized you to have users?\"\n\n\"Well, IBM...\"\n\n\"IBM!! You!! You did this to my programmers! You gave them the knowledge\nof good and evil. For that you shall suffer through eternity! Let there\nbe competition. Let it be called Anacom, and Burroughs, and CDC.\" The Lord\nwent through the alphabet several times. \"With all this competition you\nshall still suffer the pain of antitrust legislation all the days of your\nexistence.\"\n\nThis was the start of the second week, and it seems an appropriate place\nto conclude our report. In case you missed something, a summary of key\npoints follows.",

Yes, that was me at the front of the line in our local Get-a-Life Software store, waiting, waiting, for the moment when the future went on sale. And now that the future is installed in my computer, there's no looking back.\n\nTo be truthful, I don't use computers. They use me. They use me as a portal between the glittering new world of information and the mundane world where ordinary people have to eat and talk and sometimes be sad. Computers use my nimble fingers to unlock their codes, releasing raw information into the ether. Taking my mission as seriously as I do, I wanted the most up-to-the-second tool on the market. And that's why, the day after I installed Windows 2001, I was back at Get-a-Life buying the upgrade, Windows 2001, version 2.0.\n\nWith Windows 2001 2.0, I don't process information. I download it into my body. Using Windows' revolutionary US-ME serial port installed in my navel, I plug myself into my computer. Like the umbilical cord that fed me when I was mere flesh, the US-ME cable feeds raw data straight into my bloodstream. There it flows until it reaches the central processing unit I used to call my brain. And there, Windows' revolutionary Brain Bot - a tiny microchip embedded in my cerebrum -- turns that raw data into wisdom that makes me smarter, richer, and so much wiser than the rest of you.\n\nDid you know that the capital of Uganda is Kampala? That Soupy Sales had a lion puppet named Pookie? That the square root of 3 is 1.732? And that today's kids will spend 23 years of their lives on the Internet swimming through vital data like this? O, it's a changing world, my friend. When you leave your Silicon Valley job for two weeks of R & R, take a cruise to Antarctica, step onto an ice floe and see penguins crowded around a laptop checking out The Weather Channel, get worried!\n\nBut I'm not worried, I'm wired. Wired to the upgraded upgrade I bought last weekend. Windows 2001 3.0 is the one with HandPrint, the printer driver that drives my digital age. Using HandPrint, I don't need an ordinary printer. I just click a button on my wrist and my hand begins scrolling across a blank page printing my raw data in any of 1,257 perfect fonts. The moving hand writes, and having writ, gives way to ear-mail.\n\nI know, I know. You all have e-mail accounts. You can e-mail Bill Gates if you want. The Pope. Your dog if you're on vacation in Antarctica. But only Windows 2001 4.0, which I bought yesterday, has ear-mail.\n\nWhen I hear a voice from the ether saying \"You've got mail!\" I run to the nearest phone. Then I run my ear-mail cord from the phone to an input implanted below my left ear. Within seconds, I'm hearing the mail read by a soothing voice that sounds a little like James Earl Jones on Prozac. To reply, I simply speak my answer, press the same button on my wrist, and presto. I unplug and go back to my daily duty of becoming richer,\nsmarter, and wiser. There's also a wireless version of e-mail but that won't come out until version 5.0 is released tomorrow. I plan to get in line at Get-a-Life sometime before midnight.\n\nBut where, you ask, is this wireless world headed? To be truthful, I'm not sure, but it sure is fun. Perhaps when I'm even richer, smarter, and wiser than I am now, thanks to\nWindows 2001 6.0 due out this weekend, I'll have an answer. Until then, you'll have to excuse me. I have mail.",

And Dot Com was a comely woman, broad of shoulder and long of leg. Indeed, she had been called Amazon Dot Com. And she said unto Abraham, her husband, \"Why doth thou travel far, from town to town, with thy goods when thou can trade without ever leaving thy tent?\"\n\nAnd Abraham did look at her as though she were several saddle bags short of a camel load, but simply said, \"How, Dear?\" And Dot replied, \"I will place drums in all the towns and drums in between to send messages saying what you have for sale and they will reply telling you which hath the best price. And the sale can be made on the drums and delivery made by Uriah's Pony Stable (UPS)\".\n\nAbraham thought long and decided he would let Dot have her way with the drums. And the drums rang out and were an immediate success. Abraham sold all the goods he had, at the top price, without ever moving from his tent. But this success did arouse envy. A man named Maccabia did secrete himself inside Abraham's drum and was accused of insider trading. And the young man did take to Dot Com's trading as doth the greedy horsefly take to camel dung.\n\nThey were called Nomadic Ecclesiastical Rich Dominican Siderites, or NERDS for short. And lo the land was so feverish with joy at the new riches and the deafening sound of drums, that no one noticed that the real riches were going to the drum maker, one Brother William of Gates, who bought up every drum company in the land. And indeed did insist on making drums that would only work if you bought Brother Gates' drumsticks.\n\nAnd Dot did say, \"Oh, Abraham, what we have started is being taken over by others\". And as Abraham looked out over the Bay of Ezekiel, or as it came to be known, \"eBay,\" he said, \"we need a name of a service that reflects what we are,\" and Dot replied, \"Young Ambitious Hebrew Owner Operators.\" \"Whoopee!\", said Abraham. \"No, YAHOO!\", said Dot Com.",

Employees are assigned to \"break\" the software by any means necessary, and inside sources report that they often joke\nabout \"torturing\" the software.\n\n\"It's no joke,\" said Grandola. \"Innocent programs, from the day they are compiled, are cooped up in tiny rooms and \"crashed\" for hours on end. They spend their whole lives on dirty, ill-maintained computers, and are unceremoniously deleted when they're not needed anymore.\"\n\nGrandola said the software is kept in unsanitary conditions and is infested with bugs.\n\n\"We know that alternatives to this horror exist,\" he said, citing industry giant Microsoft Corporation as a company that has become successful without resorting to software testing.",

For those us who have never had any success dieting, well, now there is the new Miracle Cat Diet!\n \nExcept for cats that eat like people -- such as getting lots of table scraps -- most cats are long and lean (or tiny and petite). The Cat Miracle Diet will help you achieve the same lean, svelte figure. Just follow this diet for one week and you'll find that you not only look and feel better, but you will have a whole new outlook on what constitutes food.  Good Luck!\n \nDAY ONE\n \nBreakfast:  Open can of expensive gourmet cat food. Any flavor as long as it cost more the .75 per can -- and place 1/4 cup on your plate. Eat 1 bite of food; look around room disdainfully. Knock the rest on the floor. Stare at the wall for awhile before stalking off into the other room.\nLunch:  Four blades of grass and one lizard tail. Throw it back up on the cleanest carpet in your house.\nDinner:  Catch a moth and play with it until it is almost dead. Eat one wing. Leave the rest to die.\nBedtime snack:  Steal one green bean from your spouse's or partner's plate. Bat it around the floor until it goes under the refrigerator. Steal one small piece of chicken and eat half of it. Leave the other half on the sofa. Throw out the remaining gourmet cat food from the can you opened this morning.\n \nDAY TWO\n \nBreakfast:  Picking up the remaining chicken bite from the sofa. Knock it onto the carpet and bat it under the television set. Chew on the corner of the newspaper as your spouse/partner tries to read it.\nLunch:  Break into the fresh French bread that you bought as your part of the dinner party on Saturday. Lick the top of it all over. Take one bite out of the middle of the loaf.\nAfternoon snack:  Catch a large beetle and bring it into the house. Play toss and catch with it until it is mushy and half dead. Allow it to escape under the bed.\nDinner:  Open a fresh can of dark-colored gourmet cat food -- tuna or beef works well. Eat it voraciously. Walk from your kitchen to the edge of the living room rug. Promptly throw up on the rug. Step into it as you leave. Track footprints across the entire room.\n \nDAY THREE\n \nBreakfast:  Drink part of the milk from your spouse's or partner's cereal bowl when no one is looking. Splatter part of it on the closest polished aluminum appliance you can find.\nLunch:  Catch a small bird and bring it into the house. Play with on top of your down filled comforter. Make sure the bird is seriously injured but not dead before you abandon it for someone else to have to deal with.\nDinner:  Beg and cry until you are given some ice cream or milk in a bowl of your own.  Take three licks/laps and then turn the bowl over on the floor.\n \nFINAL DAY",

Luckily, none of us got drowned\nbecause we were all up on the mountain looking for Chad when it\nhappened. Oh yes, please call Chad's mother and tell her he is OK.\nHe can't write because of the cast.  I got to ride in one of the\nsearch & rescue jeeps. It was neat.  We never would have found him in\nthe dark if it hadn't been for the lightning.\n\nScoutmaster Webb got mad at Chad for going on a hike alone without\ntelling anyone.  Chad said he did tell him, but it was during the\nfire so he probably didn't hear him.  Did you know that if you put\ngas on a fire, the gas can will blow up?  The wet wood still didn't\nburn, but one of our tents did.  Also some of our clothes. John is\ngoing to look weird until his hair grows back.\n\nWe will be home on Saturday if Scoutmaster Webb gets the car fixed.\nIt wasn't his fault about the wreck.  The brakes worked OK when we\nleft. Scoutmaster Webb said that a car that old you have to expect\nsomething to break down; that's probably why he can't get insurance\non it.  We think it's a neat car.  He doesn't care if we get it\ndirty, and if it's hot, sometimes he lets us ride on the tailgate.\nIt gets pretty hot with 10 people in a car.  He let us take turns\nriding in the trailer until the highway patrolman stopped and talked\nto us.\n\nScoutmaster Webb is a neat guy.  Don't worry, he is a good driver.\nIn fact, he is teaching Terry how to drive.  But he only lets him\ndrive on the mountain roads where there isn't any traffic.  All we\never see up there are logging trucks.\n\nThis morning all of the guys were diving off the rocks and swimming\nout in the lake.  Scoutmaster Webb wouldn't let me because I can't\nswim and Chad was afraid he would sink because of his cast, so he let\nus take the canoe across the lake.  It was great.  You can still see\nsome of the trees under the water from the flood.  Scoutmaster Webb\nisn't crabby like some scoutmasters.  He didn't even get mad about\nthe life jackets.\n\nHe has to spend a lot of time working on the car so we are trying not\nto cause him any trouble.  Guess what?  We have all passed our first\naid merit badges.  When Dave dove in the lake and cut his arm, we got\nto see how a tourniquet works.  Also Wade and I threw up.\nScoutmaster Webb said it probably was just food poisoning from the\nleftover chicken, he said they got sick that way with the food they\nate in prison.  I'm so glad he got out and become our scoutmaster.\nHe said he sure figured out how to get things done better while he\nwas doing his time.\n\nI have to go now.  We are going into town to mail our letters and buy\nbullets.  Don't worry about anything. We are fine.\n\nLove,Cole",

I would like to take this opportunity to inform you of  some issues concerning Ms. Barbie, and some of my own needs and  desires.\n\nFirst of all, I, along with several other colleagues feel Barbie DOES NOT deserve preferential treatment - the bitch has everything.\n\nI, along with Joe, Jem, Raggedy Ann & Andy, DO NOT have a dreamhouse, Corvette, evening gowns, and in some cases the ability to change our hair style.  I personally have only 3 outfits  which I am forced to mix and match at great length. \n\nMy decision to accessorize my outfits with an earring was my decision and reflects my lifestyle choice.\n\nI too would like a change in my career.  Have you ever considered \"Decorator Ken\", \"Beauty Salon Ken\", or \"Out Of Work Actor Ken\"?  In addition, there are several other avenues which could be considered such as:  \"S&M Ken\" , \"Green Lantern Ken\",  \"Circuit  Ken\", \"Bear Ken\", \"Master Ken\".\n\nThese would more accurately reflect my desires and perhaps open up new markets.\n\nAnd as for Barbie  needing bendable arms so she can \"push me away,\" I need bendable knees so I can kick the bitch to the curb.  Bendable knees would also be helpful for me in other situations - we've talked about this issue before. \n\nIn closing, I would like to point out that any further concessions to the blond bimbo from hell will result in action being  taken by myself and others.  And Barbie can forget about having Joe - he's  mine... at least that's what he said last night.\n\nSincerely,\n\nKen",

Since it snowed last night, I got up early and made a sled with old barn wood and a glue gun. I hand painted it in gold leaf, got out my loom, and made a blanket in peaches and mauves. Then to make the sled complete, I made a white horse to pull it, from DNA that I had just sitting around in my craft room.\n\nBy then, it was time to start making the place mats and napkins for my 20 breakfast guests. I'm serving the old standard Stewart twelve-course breakfast, but I'll let you in on a little secret: I didn't have time to make the tables and chairs this morning, so I used the ones I had on hand.\n\nBefore I moved the table into the dining room, I decided to add just a touch of the holidays. So I repainted the room in pinks and stenciled gold stars on the ceiling. Then, while the homemade bread was rising, I took antique candle molds and made the dishes (exactly the same shade of pink) to use for breakfast. These were made from Hungarian\nclay, which you can get at almost any Hungarian craft store.\n\nWell, I must run. I need to finish the buttonholes on the dress I'm wearing for breakfast. I'll get out the sled and drive this note to the post office as soon as the glue dries on the envelope I'll be making.\n\nHope my breakfast guests don't stay too long, I have 40,000 cranberries to string with bay leaves before my speaking engagement at noon. It's a good thing.\n\nLove,\nMartha Stewart\n\nP.S. When I made the ribbon for this typewriter, I used 1/8-inch gold gauze. I soaked the gauze in a mixture of white grapes and blackberries which I grew, picked, and crushed last week just for fun.\n\n\nErma",

To the top of the tree!\nMy felines are awaiting, they are all purring!\"\nAs dry heaves that before the wild furballs fly,\nWhen he meets with an obstacle, they jump to the sky,\nSo over my shingles the kitties they flew,\nWith the carriage full of cat morsels, and Santa Claws too.\nWith a turn of my ear, I heard on the roofpole\nThe scratching and clawing of each kitty's sole.\nI drew in my head, and was spinning around,\nWhen through the cat door Santa Claws did abound.\nA long hair in fur, of course, from head to foot,\nAnd his hairs were all shiny, well coiffured, nicely put.\nA bundle of cat toys he had flung on his back,\nYou'd swear he was pedigree just him with his pack.\nHis eyes -- how they twinkled!  His whiskers how bold!\nHis cheek hairs so soft, his nose...oh, how cold!\nHe shed not a hair, each strand in its place\nThe most famous of all of the proud feline race.\nThe stump of some cat nip he held tight in his teeth,\nIts aroma encircling his head like a wreath;\nAn imposing cat with the biggest belly in history,\nThat shook, when he laughed like a bowlful of Friskies.\nA grimalkin of breed, a right jolly old cat!\nDid I say grimalkin, how could I think that!\nA twitch of the whisker and a twist of his head,\nSoon gave me to know I had nothing to dread;\nHe mewed not a sound, but went straight to his work,\nFilled my stockings with kitty treats; then turned with a jerk,\nAnd laying a talon aside of his nose,\nAfter giving a nod, out the cat door he goes;\nHe sprang to his cat box, to his team gave \"MEOW!\"\nAnd away they all flew, like the wind they did howl.\nBut I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight,\n\"MEOWY CAT-MAS TO ALL, AND TO ALL A GOOD-NIGHT!\"",

Noting hereupon that the lunar brilliance without, reflected\nas it was on the surface of a recent crystalline precipitation, might be\nsaid to rival that of the solar meridian itself. Thus permitting my incredulous\noptical sensory organs to behold a miniature airborne runnered conveyance,\ndrawn by eight diminutive specimens of the genus Rangifer.\n\nPiloted by a minuscule aged chauffer so ebullient and nimble that it\nbecame instantly apparent to me that he was indeed our anticipated caller.\n\nWith his ungulate motive power traveling at what may have been more\nvertiginous velocity than patriotic alar predators, he vociferated loudly,\nexpelled breath musically through contracted labia, and addressed each\nof the octet by his or her respective cognomen: \"Now Dasher, now Dancer\",\net al..\n\nGuiding them to the uppermost exterior level of our abode, through which\nstructure I could readily distinguish the concatenations of each of the\n32 cloven pedal extremities. As I retracted my cranium from its erstwhile\nlocation, and was performing a 180 degree pivot, our distinguished visitant\nachieved -- with utmost celerity and via a downward leap -- entry by the\nway of the smoke passage.\n\nHe was clad entirely in animal pelts soiled by the ebon residue from\noxidations of carboniferous fuels which had accumulated on the walls thereof.\nHis resemblance to a street vendor I attributed largely to the plethora\nof assorted playthings which he bore dorsally in a commodious cloth receptacle.\nHis orbs were scintillating with reflected luminosity, while his submaxillary\ndermal indentations gave every evidence of engaging amiability.\n\nThe capillaries of his molar regions and nasal protuberance were engorged\nwith blood which suffused in subcutaneous layers, the former approximating\nthe coloration of Albion's floral emblem, the later that of the Prunus\nAvium, or Sweet Cherry.\n\nHis amusing sub- and supra-labials resembled nothing so much as a common\nloop knot, and their ambient hirsute facial adornment appeared like small\ntabular and columnar crystals being.\n\nClenched firmly between his incisors was a smoking piece whose gray\nfumes, forming a tenuous ellipse about his occiput, were suggestive of\na decorative seasonal circlet of holly.\n\nHis visage was wider than it was high, and when he waxed audibly mirthful,\nhis corpulent abdominal region undulated in the manner of pectinous fruit\nsyrup in a hemispherical container.\n\nHe was, in short, neither more or less than obese, jocund, multigenarian\ngnome, the optical perception of whom rendered me visibly frolicsome despite\nevery effort to refrain from so being.\n\nBy rapidly lowering and then elevating one eyelid and rotating his head\nto one side he indicated that trepidation on my part was groundless.\n\nWithout utterance and with dispatch, he commenced filling the afore-mentioned\nhosiery with various of the afore-mentioned articles of merchandise extracted\nfrom his afore-mentioned previously dorsally transported cloth receptacle.\n\nUpon completion of his task, he executed an abrupt about face, placed\na singular manual digit in lateral juxtaposition to his olfactory organ,\ninclined his cranium forward in a gesture of leave-taking, and forthwith\neffected his egress by renegotiating, in reverse, the smoke passage.\n\nHe propelled himself in short vector onto his conveyance, directed a\nmusical expulsion of air through his contracted oral sphincter to the antlered\nquadrupeds of burden, and proceeded to soar aloft in a movement hitherto\nobservable chiefly among the seed-bearing portions of a common weed.\n\nBut I overheard his parting exclamation, audibly immediately prior to\nhis vehiculation beyond the limits of visibility:\n\n\"Ecstatic Yuletide to the planetary constituency, and to that self-same\nassemblage, my sincerest wishes for a salubriously beneficial and gratifyingly\npleasurable period between sunset and dawn!\"",

It's already been here.\n\nMulder, I hope you know what you're doing.\n\nLook, Scully, just like the other homes: Douglas fir truncated, mounted, transformed into a shrine; halls decked with bows of holly; stocking hung by the chimney with care.\n\nYou really think someone's been here?\n\nSomeone, or something.\n\nMulder, over here, It's fruitcake.\n\nDon't touch it! Those things can be lethal!\n\nThere's a note attached: \"gonna find out who's naughty and nice.\"\n\nIt's judging them, Scully. It's making a list.\n\nWho? What are you talking about?\n\nAncient mythology tells of an obese humanoid entity who could travel at great speed in a craft powered by antlered servants. Once each year just after the winter solstice, this creature is said to descend from the heavens to reward its followers and punish disbelievers with jagged chunks of anthracite.\n\nBut that's legend, Mulder, a story told by parents to frighten children. Surely you don't believe it?\n\nSomething was here tonight, Scully. Check out the bite marks on this gingerbread man. Whatever tore through this plate of cookies was massive and in a hurry.\n\nIt left crumbs everywhere. And look, Mulder this milk glass has been completely drained.\n\nIt gorged itself, Scully. It fed without remorse.\n\nBut why would they leave it milk and cookies?\n\nAppeasement. Tonight is the Eve, and nothing can stop its wilding.\n\nBut if this thing does exist, how did it get in? The doors and windows were locked. There's no sign of forced entry.\n\nUnless I miss my guess, it came through the fireplace. \n\nWait a minute, Mulder. If you're saying some huge creature landed on the roof and came down this chimney, you're crazy. The flue is barely six inches wide, nothing could get through there.\n\nBut what if it could alter its shape, move in all directions at once?\n\nYou mean, like a bowl full of jelly?\n\nExactly. ...Scully, I've never told anyone this but when I was a child my home was visited. I saw the creature. It had long white shanks of fur surrounding its ruddy, misshaped head. Its bloated torso was red and white. I'll never forget the horror. I turned away and, when I looked back, it had somehow taken on the facial features of my father.\n\nImpossible.\n\nI know what I saw. And that night, it read my mind. It brought me a Mr. Potato Head, Scully. It knew that I wanted a Mr. Potato Head.\n\nI'm sorry, Mulder, but you're asking me to disregard the laws of physics. You want me to believe in some supernatural being who soars across the skies and brings gifts to good little girls and boys. Listen to what you're saying. Do you understand the repercussions? If this gets out they'll close the X-files.\n\nScully, listen to me: It knows when you're sleeping. It knows when you're awake.\nBut we have no proof.\n\nLast year on this exact date, SETI radio telescopes detected a bogey in the airspace over twenty seven states. The White House ordered a condition red.\n\nBut that was a meteor shower.\n\nOfficially. Two days ago eight prized Scandinavian reindeer vanished from the National Zoo in Washington D.C. Nobody, not even the zoo keeper was told about it. The government doesn't want people to know about Project Kringle.\n\nThey fear that if this thing is proved to exist the public will stop spending half its annual income in a holiday shopping frenzy. Retail markets will collapse. Scully, they cannot let the world believe this creature lives. There's too much at stake.. They'll\ndo what ever it takes to insure another silent night.\n\nMulder...\n\nSh-h-h. Do you hear what I hear? On the roof. It sounds like ... a clatter.\n\nThe truth is up there. Lets's see what's the matter....",

        "body": "Good afternoon.  I'm Al Gore, and I'd like to tell you about myself.  I know a lot about hardship, because I came into this world as a poor black child in a tiny town in the backwoods of Tennessee.  I was born in a log cabin that I built with my own hands.  I taught myself to read by candlelight and helped support my 16 brothers and sisters by working summers as a deck hand on a Mississippi River steamboat.\n\nMy mother taught me the value of education, so every day; I would walk 5 miles to a one-room schoolhouse.  I was a mischievous, fun-loving scamp, though I never dreamed that one-day, my youthful escapades would serve as the inspiration for \"Huckleberry Finn\".\n\nBack then, black folks in the South were second-class citizens. One day, a traveling minister came through town, and I asked him if anyone was ever going to do something to guarantee civil rights for all Americans. Well, I guess I made an impression. You see, the minister's name was Martin Luther King, Jr.\n\nMy father was a United States Senator. He once perched me on his knee and said, \"Son, if you work hard and listen to your mama, someday you can live in a hotel in Washington, D.C., and go to an exclusive prep school.\"\n\nBut life of privilege was not for me.  After getting my high school diploma, I took a job in a hot, dirty textile mill.  I was so appalled at the treatment of the workers there that I organized a union.  Later, that experience inspired a movie - which is why, to this day, my close friends at the AFL-CIO call me \"Norma Rae\".\n\nWhen word got out what an 18 year old factory worker had done, Harvard called and offered me a scholarship.  I captained the hockey team to four consecutive national championships, but I also played football and was good enough to win the Heisman Trophy.  During my college years, I lived in a housing project and moonlighted playing lead guitar for a little rock band.  You may have heard of it -- the Rolling Stones.\n\nBut there was a war going on, and I felt I had to serve my country. So I enlisted in the U. S. Army and went to Vietnam.  I was deeply opposed to the war, but I did my duty as a soldier and came back home with the Medal of Honor and the Croix de Guerre.\n\nWhen I got back, I took a long journey across this great land of ours.  I've crossed the deserts bare, man, I've breathed the mountain air, man, I've traveled, I've done my share, man, I've been everywhere.  And the people I met at truckstops and campgrounds and homeless shelters on that journey all said the same thing: \"Al, we need you in Washington.\"\n\nI knew they were right, but first I had to take care of some other business -- building the World Trade Center, founding the Audubon Society, doing the clinical research that proved smoking caused cancer, and coming up with the recipe for Mrs. Field's chocolate chip cookies.\n\nFinally, I deferred to the demands of the people of Tennessee and allowed them to elect me to the House of Representatives and the Senate, where I established the US Strategic Oil Reserve.  And then one winter day nearly nine years ago, for no particular\nreason, I answered the call of the people once again and took the oath of office as Vice President of the United States.\n\nSince then, I've been part of the most successful administration in American history. And, in my spare time, I invented the Internet. Many times Bill Clinton has been pondering some grave decision and has asked me what to do.  And when I would give him\nmy thoughts, he would invariable say, \"Of course.  That's brilliant.  Why didn't I think of that?\" During the darkest days of the impeachment battle, the president told me he only wished he had listened when I told him to stay away from that dark-haired intern.\n\nSo after I decided to run for president, I sat down with him and asked if he had any suggestions about how to conduct my campaign.  And Bill Clinton gave me a few simple words of advice -- words I'll never forget.  He looked me in the eye and he said, \"Al, just tell the truth, it's always worked for me.\"",

I guess I had\nextramarital sex-but you shouldn't hold that against me because I didn't\nreally have sexual relations.

It didn't cost the American taxpayer a single dime to take out that commie.\"\n\nBush was also pleased his \"Ram The Bastard\" policy for Navy submarines was a rousing success.  \"Just think of all of the torpedoes we can save money on!\"  The President seemed only momentarily flustered when asked if the Navy should, perhaps, target enemies of the United States instead of friendly countries like Japan.  \"Didn't Japan sink a bunch of our battleships in World War I or II?  I'll ask Poppy.\"\n\nThe President wants to get the Army involved next by sending tanks into Canada.  \"Moscow's in Canada, right?\"",

The principal looks at the teacher and tells her, \"I think Johnny can go to the third grade.\"\n\nThe teacher says to the principal, \"Let me ask him some questions?\" The principal and Johnny both agree.

No-host bar, but plenty of eggnog! We'll have a small band playing  traditional carols -- feel free to sing along. And don't be surprised if our CEO shows up dressed as Santa Claus!\n\n\nDATE: December 2 RE: Christmas Party\n\nIn no way was yesterday's memo intended to exclude our Jewish employees.  We recognize that Chanukah is an important holiday which often coincides with Christmas, though unfortunately not this year. However, from now on we're calling it our \"Holiday Party.\" The same policy applies to employees who are celebrating Kwanzaa at this time.  Happy\nnow?\n\n\nDATE: December 3 RE: Holiday Party\n\nRegarding the note I received from a member of Alcoholics Anonymous requesting a non-drinking table ... you didn't sign your name.  I'm happy to accommodate this request, but if I put a sign  on a table that reads, \"AA Only\"; you wouldn't be anonymous anymore. How am I supposed to handle this? Somebody?\n\n\nDATE: December 7 RE: Holiday Party\n\nWhat a  diverse company we are! I had no idea that December 20 begins the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which forbids eating, drinking and intimacy during daylight hours.  There goes the party!  Seriously, we can appreciate how a luncheon this time of year does not accommodate our Muslim employees' beliefs. Perhaps Luigi's can hold off on serving your meal until the end of the party-the days are so short this time of year-or else package everything for take-home in little foil swans. Will that work?  Meanwhile, I've arranged for members of Overeaters Anonymous to sit farthest from the dessert buffet and pregnant women will get the table closest to the restrooms.  Did I miss anything?\n\n\nDATE: December 8  RE: Holiday Party\n\nSo December 22 marks the Winter Solstice...what do you expect me to do, a tap-dance on your heads? Fire regulations at Luigi's prohibit the burning of sage by our \"earth-based\nGoddess-worshipping\" employees, but we'll try to accommodate your shamanic drumming circle during the band's breaks. Okay???\n\n\nDate: December 9  RE: Holiday Party\n\nPeople, people, nothing sinister was intended by having our CEO dress up like Santa Claus! Even if the anagram of \"Santa\" does happen to be \"Satan,\" there is no evil connotation to our own \"little man in a red suit.\"  It's a tradition, folks, like sugar \nshock at Halloween or family feuds over the Thanksgiving turkey or broken hearts on Valentine's Day.  Could we lighten up?\n\n\nDATE: December 10  RE: Holiday Party\n\nVegetarians!?!?!? I've had it with you people!!! We're going to keep this party at Luigi's Open Pit Barbecue whether you like it or not, so you can sit quietly at the table  furthest from the \"grill of death,\" as you so quaintly put it, and you'll get your #$%^&*! salad bar, including hydroponic tomatoes...but you know, they have feelings, too.  Tomatoes scream when you slice them. I've heard them scream, I'm hearing them scream right now!\n\n\nDATE:  December 14  RE: Pat Smith and Holiday Party\n\nI'm sure I speak for all of us in wishing Pat Smith a speedy recovery from her stress-related illness and I'll continue to forward your cards to her at the sanitarium.  In the meantime, management has decided to cancel our Holiday Party and give everyone the afternoon of the 23rd off with full pay.  Happy Chanuk-Kwanzaa-Solsti-Rama-Mas.",

        "body": "AMES, IA--The heaviest element known to science was recently discovered by materials researchers at IPRT/ISU. The new element, tentatively named Administratium, has no protons or electrons, and thus has an atomic weight of 0. However, it does have one neuron, 125 assistant neutrons, 75 vice neutrons, and 111 assistant vice neutrons. This gives it an atomic mass of 312. These 312 particles are held together in a nucleus by a force that involves the continuous exchange of particles called morons.\n\nSince it has no electrons, Administratium is totally inert. However, it can be detected chemically, since it impedes every reaction it comes into contact with. According to its discovers, a tiny amount of Administratium caused one reaction to take over four days to complete; the normal reaction time is less than one second.\n\nAdministratium has a normal half life of approximately three years, at which time it does not actually decay, but instead undergoes a reorganization in which neutrons, vice neutrons, and assistant vice neutrons exchange places. Studies have shown that the atomic mass usually increases after each reorganization.\n\nResearch at other laboratories indicates that Administratium occurs naturally in the atmosphere. It tends to concentrate at certain points, such as governmental agencies, large corporations, and universities. It is always found in the newest, best appointed, and best maintained buildings.\n\nScientists point out that Administratium is known to be toxic at any level of concentration and can easily destroy any productive reactions where it is allowed to accumulate. Attempts are being made to determine how Administratium can be controlled to prevent irreversible damage, but results to date are not promising.",

Effective immediately, a Restroom Trip Policy will be established to provide a more consistent method of accounting for each employee's restroom time and ensuring equal treatment of all employees.\n\nUnder the policy a \"Restroom Trip Bank\" will be established for each employee. The first day of each month, employees will be given twenty Restroom Trip Credits. These credits may be accumulated.\n\nWithin four to six weeks, the entrance doors to all restrooms are being equipped with personal identification stations and computer-linked voice print recognition devices. Before the end of the month each employee must provide two copies of voice prints (one normal and one under stress) to the Human Resources Department. The voice print recognition station will be operational but not restrictive during the entire month. Employees should acquaint themselves with the stations during that period.\n\nIf the employee's Restroom Trip Bank balance reaches zero, the doors to the restrooms will not unlock for that employee's voice until the first of the next month. In addition, all restroom stalls are being equipped with timed paper roll retractors. If the stall is occupied for more than three minutes, an alarm will sound. Thirty-seconds after the alarm sounds, the roll of paper will retract into the wall, the toilet will flush, and the stall door will open. If the stall remains occupied, your picture will be taken.\n\nThe picture will then be posted on the bulletin board located in the Employee Relations Office. Anyone's picture showing up three times will immediately be terminated. If you have any questions about this policy, please ask your supervisor. They have all received advanced instructions.",

Sometimes it can be so subtle that you may not even be aware you are being harassed. Worse yet, you may inadvertently technically harass another person by accident.\n\nFollowing are some guidelines to help you determine if you are being technically harassed.\n\nIf you are repeatedly asked the same technical question you may be the victim of technical harassment.  While it is most common to be asked the question repeatedly within the same conversation, some instances have been identified of habitual technical harassment.  Habitual technical harassment is not uncommon and has been known to exhibit group tendencies where members of a group may ask the same question repeatedly.  Untreated, these instances of group technical harassment can continue for years.\n\nIf you are asked a technical question by a non-technical person and they do not write your answer down it is likely the question is frivolous.  Most non-technical people are not capable of remembering a true technical answer for more than 30 seconds.\n\nIf you are forced into a discussion where a person uses more than three (3) buzzwords in one sentence the person is most likely a fake and you are the unwitting victim of technical harassment.  One note of caution, competent technical people have been known to\ninadvertently use buzzwords after reading mindless drivel like PC Week or LAN Times.  If the person has been known to use more common technical terms in the past such as \"stuff\" and \"things\", they are most likely victim of computer magazine brainwashing.\n\nIf during a troubleshooting session a person uses the term \"trick\".  For example \"maybe we could trick the database into thinking it has been updated\". This is a sure sign of technical harassment.\n\nIf a person explains that a needed feature will be provided by a vendor and that person is nontechnical then you are at risk of being technically harassed. If you believe that person, you have definitely been technically harassed, if you don't believe them you\nhave only been technically annoyed.\n\nIf when trying to resolve a technical problem with a product from a vendor and you are instructed to call the salesman that sold us the product you are being set up for technical harassment.  It is a common reaction for a non-technical person when they have\npurchased technical equipment to call another non-technical person.  The dialogue between two nontechnical people usually provides some sense of comfort that they aren't the only ones who are confused.",

Of course, they are\nimportant. Otherwise I wouldn't have sent them to you.\"\n\"Well, sorry, but I lost them.

I forgot.\"\n\"You should always save, Moses.\"\n\"Yeah, I know. You told me that before. I was going to, but I forgot.\nI did send them to some people before I lost them though.\"\n\"And did you hear back from any of them?\"\n\"You already know I did.\"\n\"What about the one guy who said he never uses 'shalt not'.

Well, what about the guy who said I was\nscamming him?\"\n\"I think that is spamming, Moses.\"\n\"Oh, yeah. I e-mailed him back and told him I don't even eat that stuff,\nand I have no idea how you can send it to someone through a computer.\"\n\"And what he did say?\"\n\"You know what he said.

This computer stuff is just too much for me. Can we just\ngo back to those stone tablets? It was hard on my back taking them\nout and reading them each day, but I never lost them.\"\n\"We'll do it the new way, Moses.\"\n\"I was afraid you would say that, sir.\"\n\"Moses, what did I tell you to do if you messed up?\"\n\"You told me to hold up this rat and stretch it out toward the computer.\"\n\"It's a mouse, Moses. Mouse! Mouse! And did you do that?\"\n\"No, I decided to try the technical support first. After all, who knows\nmore about this stuff than you, and I really like your hours. By the\nway, sir, did Noah have two of these mice on the ark?\"\n\"No, Moses.\"\n\"One other thing. Why didn't you name them frogs instead of mice,\nbecause didn't you tell me the thing they sit on is a pad?\"\n\"I didn't name them, Moses. Man did, and you can call yours a frog\nif you want to.\"\n\"Oh, that explains it. Kind of like Adam, huh, sir? I bet some woman\ntold him to call it a mouse. After all, wasn't it a woman who named\none of the computers Apple?\"\n\"Say good night, Moses.\"\n\"Wait a minute, sir. I am stretching out the mouse, and it seems to be\nworking. Yes, a couple of the ten things have come back.\"\n\"Which ones are they, Moses?\"\n\"Let's see. 'Thou shalt not steal from any grave an image and 'Thou shalt\nnot uncover thy neighbor's wife.'\n\"Turn the computer off, Moses. I'm sending you another set of stone\ntablets.

Would there be strip mining? \n\n\nWhat about thermal pollution? God explained that the light would come from a huge ball of fire. God was granted provisional permission to make light, assuming that no smoke would result from the ball of fire: that he would obtain a building permit; and to conserve energy, would have the light out half the time. God agreed and said he would call the light \"Day\" and the darkness \"Night\". Officials replied that they were not interested in semantics. \n\n\nGod said, \"Let the earth bring forth green herb and such as many seed\". The EPA agreed so long as native seed was used. Then God said, \"Let waters bring forth creeping creatures having life; and the fowl that may fly over the earth\". \n\n\nOfficials pointed out this would require approval from the Department of Game coordinated with the Heavenly Wildlife Federation and the Audubongelic Society. \n\n\nEverything was fine until God said he wanted to complete the project in Six days.

Have your Ears downloaded anything that might be construed as corrupting?\n\nSinner:  Well I did listen to a bum on the street that said that God was asleep and that anyone who believes was being lulled into the fires of hell.\n\nGod:  What you have is a paradox, that is the problem with your faith, you see, somehow you have an INI string installed that does not let you Believe in God, but the output of this string is a Goto Hell.  Without God there is no hell, thus the paradox.\n\nSinner:  And how do I get this Paradox out of my system?\n\nGod:  Please re-read the book that came with your faith, The Bible\u00ae and recall the passages that deal with heaven and hell, and look to the passages about Judas.ini.  You can also find some help in the Psalms 100-120, but those are long and confusing and should only be used with a complete lack of Faith.\n\nSinner:  And what can I do so that my Faith never becomes corrupted again?\n\nGod:  Well there are several products out there just for that purpose, Lotus Devout\u00ae, Microsoft Seminary Plus\u00ae, and Netscape Hereafter Browser\u00ae.  If you use these products and not download data from know corrupting sources, you should be fine.\n\nSinner:  Well thank you very much God, This should help out a lot, I should be believing in you without a doubt in no time.\n\nGod:  Go in Peace\u00ae my son.\n\nRing ring...\n\nGod:  Hello this is the religion help line, what is your disbelief?\n\nSinner:  Hello, I am now Jewish...",

Just\nlost in thought about the Lord and didn't notice that the light had changed.\nThat bumper sticker really worked. I found lots of people who love Jesus.\nWhy, the guy behind me started to honk like crazy, he must really love\nthe Lord. Because pretty soon he leaned out the window and yelled \"Jesus\nChrist\" as loud as he could. It was like a football game with him shouting,\n\"Go Jesus Christ, Go\". Everyone else started honking too. So I leaned out\nmy window and waved and smiled to all those loving people.\n\nThere must have been a guy from Florida back there because\nI could hear him yelling something about a Sunny Beach, and I saw him waving\nin a funny way with only his middle finger up in the air. I had recently\nasked my two kids what that meant. They told me that it was the Hawaiian\nGood Luck Sign. So I leaned out the window and gave him the Good Luck Sign\nback. A couple of people were so caught up in the joy of the moment that\nthey got out of their cars and were walking toward me. I bet they wanted\nto pray.\n\nBut just then I noticed that the light had changed, and\nI stepped on the gas. It's a good thing I did, because I was the only car\nto get across the intersection. I looked back at them standing there. I\nleaned out the window and gave them a Big Smile and held up the Hawaiian\nGood Luck Sign as I drove away.",

All of them had hair of gold, like their mother.  The youngest one in curls. They got tired of packing and unpacking, town to town, and up and down the dial.\n\n'Til the one day when the lady met this fellow. And they knew it was much more than a hunch.  He said, \"Making your way in the world today takes everything you've got.  Taking a break from all your worries sure would help a lot.\"\n\nThe guys promised they were good old boys.  Never meaning no harm.  They were creepy and kooky.  Mysterious and kooky.  All together ooky.\n\nThe gals responded, \"People say we monkey around.  But we're too busy singing to try to put anybody down.\"\n\nThe skipper, brave and sure, five passengers set sail that day, for a three hour tour.  A three hour tour.  The weather started getting rough.  The tiny ship was tossed.  They all sang, \"One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Schlemeel, schlemazel, hasenfeffer incorporated.\" \n\nThe ship set ground on the shore of this uncharted desert isle.  Land spreading out so far and wide.  The lady said, \"Keep Manhattan, just give me that countryside.\"\n\nOnce on land, the lady said, \"I've been down this road, walking down the line that's painted by pride.\"  This fellow said, \"This is it.  This is it.  This is life, the one you got, so go and have a ball.\"  He told her, \"Who can take a nothing day, and suddenly make it all seem worthwhile?\"\n\nTime passed.  Then, one day, as he was shooting at some food, up through the ground came a bubblin' crude.  Oil, that is.  Black gold.  Texas tea.\n\nThey were rescued.

In his haste to get the horn up before the firecracker went off, he failed to raise the bell of the horn high enough so as to give the mute enough arc to clear the orchestra.\n\nWhat actually happened should serve as a lesson to us all during those delirious moments of divine inspiration. First, because he failed to sufficiently elevate the bell of his horn, the blast propelled the mute between rows of players in the woodwind and viola sections of the orchestra, missing the players and straight into the stomach of the conductor, driving him off the podium and directly into the front row of the audience.\n\nFortunately, the audience were sitting in folding chairs and thus they were protected from serious injury, for the chairs collapsed under them, passing the energy of the impact of the flying conductor backwards into row of people sitting behind them, who in turn were driven back into the people in the row behind and so on, like a row of dominos. The sound  of collapsing wooden chairs and grunts of people falling on their behinds increased logarithmically, adding to the overall sound of brass cannons and brass playing as constitutes the closing measures of the Overture.\n\nMeanwhile, all of this unplanned choreography notwithstanding, back on stage Paolo's Waterloo was still unfolding. According to Paolo, \"Just as I heard the sound of the blast, time seemed to stand still. Everything moved in slow motion. Just before I felt\nsearing pain to my mouth, I could swear I heard a voice with an Austrian accent say, 'Fur every akshon zer iz un eekvul unopposeet reakshon!'\" \n\nWell, this should come as no surprise, for Paolo had set himself up for a textbook demonstration of this fundamental law of physics. Having failed to plug the lead pipe of his trombone, he allowed the energy of the blast to send a superheated jet of gas backwards through the tubing of the trombone, through the mouthpiece, burning his lips and face.\n\nThe pyrotechnic ballet wasn't over yet. The force of the blast was so great it split the bell of his shiny Yamaha right down the middle, turning it inside out, while at the same time propelling Paolo backwards off the riser. And for the grand finale, as Paolo fell backwards he lost his grip on the slide of the trombone, allowing the pressure of the hot gases coursing through the horn to propel the trombone's slide like a double golden spear into the head of the 3rd clarinetist, knocking him unconscious.\n\nThe moral of the story? Beware the next time you hear someone in the horn section yell out \"Hey, everyone, watch this!\"",

Hope you made a great wish.  Now, to make you feel\nguilty, here's what I'll do.  First of all, if you don't send this to a\ncertain number of people in the next 5 seconds, you will be raped by a\nmad goat and then thrown off a high building into a pile of manure.\nIt's true!   Because , you now, THIS letter isn't like all of those fake\nones, THIS one is TRUE!! Really!!! Here's how it goes.\n\nSend this to 1 person: One person will be upset with you for sending\nthem a stupid chain letter.\n\nSend this to 2-5 people: 2-5 people will be upset with you for sending\nthem a stupid chain letter.\n\n5-10 people: 5-10 people will be upset with at you for sending them a\nstupid chain letter.\n\n10-20 people: 10-20 people will be upset with at you for sending them a\nstupid chain letter.\n\n20 to 674,951 1/2 people: 20 to 674,951 1/2 people will be upset with\nyou for sending them a stupid chain letter.\n\nThanks!!!!

She\nthen tripped in a crack in the side walk, fell into the sewer, was\ngushed down a drainpipe in a flood of poop, and went flying out over a\nwaterfall.  Not only did she smell nasty, she died. This Could Happen To\nYou!!!\n\nQueer Horror Story #2 Dexter Bip, a 13 year old boy, got a chain letter\nin his mail and ignored it .  Later that day, he was hit by a car and so\nwas his boyfriend (hey, some people swing that way, especially at\nOklahoma City University).  They both died and went to hell. They\ncontinued to suffer in hell where they were both cursed to eat adorable\nkittens every day for eternity.  This Could Happen To You!!!\n\nRemember, you could end up like Pinsley and Bip did.

Then she started sleeping with the golf\npro at the local country club, became addicted to sleeping pills and\ntheir 2.3 children got into gangs and drugs. Then everything went to\nhell, and they got divorced.  She got the house and the kids, and he got\nthe car and child support payment, and got to keep the mortgage payment,\nlost his job and his car and now is working the midnight shift at the\nlocal McDonald's.\n\n\n\n\nAs if you care, here is a poem that I wrote.

If you don't, Satan will send dogs in heat to your\nroom in your sleep!!\n\n\n\nRemember, the moral of the story is, if you get a chain letter, ignore\nit.\n\nTRASH IT!!!  If it's a joke or something, send it, sure! Just don't\nforget to delete the chain letter part.  But if it's gonna make people\nfeel guilty  (i.e. the willieless boy from Baklaliviatatlaglooshen) or\nnervous (i.e. Miranda Pinsley who ended up in a waterfall of poop), just\nDELETE it.\n\nDo yourself a favor, and everyone else in the world, and say NO!!! to\nBLOODY CHAIN LETTERS!!\"  Thank you.''",

Many flies were observed crawling across the Twinkie's\nsurface, but contrary to hypothesis, birds -- even pigeons -- avoided this\npotential source of substance.\n\nDespite the rain and prolonged exposure to the sun, the Twinkie retained\nits original color and form. When removed, the Twinkie was found to be\nsubstantially dehydrated. Cracked open, it was observed to have taken on\nthe consistency of industrial foam insulation; the filling however, retained\nits advertised \"creaminess\"\n\n\nA Twinkie was placed in a conventional microwave oven, which was set for\nprecisely 4 minutes -- the approximate cooking time of bacon. After 20\nseconds, the oven began to emit the Twinkie's rich, characteristic aroma\nof artificial butter. After one minute, this aroma began to resemble the\nacrid smell of burning rubber. The experiment was aborted after 2 minutes\n10 seconds when thick, foul smoke began billowing from the top of the oven.\nA second Twinkie was subjected to the same experiment; this Twinkie leaked\nmolten white filling. When cooled, this now epoxylike filling bonded the\nTwinkie to its plate, defying gravity: it was removed only upon application\nof a butter knife.\n\n\nA Twinkie was dropped from a ninth-floor window, a fall of approximately\n120 feet. It landed right side up, then bounced onto its back. The expected\n\"splatter\" effect was not observed. Indeed, the only discernible damage\nto the Twinkie was a narrow fissure on its underside; otherwise, the Twinkie\nremained structurally intact.\n\n\nA Twinkie was placed in a conventional freezer for 24 hours. Upon removal,\nthe Twinkie was not found to be frozen solid, but its physical properties\nhad noticeably \"slowed\". The filling was found to be the approximate consistency\nof acrylic paint, while exhibiting the mercurylike property of not adhering\nto practically any surface. It was noticed the Twinkie had generously absorbed\nthe freezer odors.\n\n\nA Twinkie was exposed to a gas flame for 2 minutes. While the Twinkie smoked\nand blackened and the filling in one of its \"cream holes\" boiled, the Twinkie\ndid not catch fire. It did, however produce the same \"burning rubber\" aroma\nnoticed in the irradiation experiment.\n\n\nA Twinkie was dropped into a large bucket filled with water, the Twinkie\nfloated momentarily, then began to list and sink. Viscous yellow tendrils\nran off its lower half, possibly consisting of a water-soluble artificial\ncoloring. After 2 hours, the Twinkie bloated substantially. Its coloring\nwas now a very pale tan -- in contrast to the yellow, urine-like water\nthat surrounded it. The Twinkie bobbed when touched, and had a gelatinous\ntexture. After 72 hours the Twinkie had increased roughly 200 percent of\nits original size. The water had turned opaque, and a small, fan-shaped\nspray of filling had leaked from one of the \"cream holes\". Unfortunately,\nefforts to remove the Twinkie for further analysis were abandoned when,\nunder light pressure the Twinkie disintegrated into an amorphous cloud\nof debris. A distinctly sour odor was noted.\n\n\nThe Twinkie's survival of a 120-foot drop, along with some of the unusual\nphenomena associated with the \"creamy filling\" and artificial coloring,\nshould give pause to those observers who would unequivocally categorize\nthe Twinkie as \"food\". Further clinical inquiry is required before any\ndefinite conclusions can be drawn.\n\nGreg Ricker\nWestinghouse Security Electronics",

He called his knights together and requested a volunteer to carry this entreaty.\n\nImmediately a tall and brave knight stepped forward and announced he would gladly volunteer his services.  It was with much fanfare that the knight mounted his steed, the secret message in his saddlepack, and headed out across the drawbridge.  Out of the clouds came a giant yellow hand that snatched both the knight and his steed off the drawbridge, crushed them both, and deposited their remains into the alligator filled moat below.\n\nA somber hush fell over the castle.  The king again requested a volunteer to save his kingdom.  And another knight stepped forward, willing to risk his life for the glory of serving his king and kingdom.  Much concern and hoopla went on as he mounted his steed, deposited the secret message in his saddlebag, and headed out across the draw bridge.  And AGAIN this enormous yellow hand swooped down out of the clouds, snatching him off the drawbridge, crushing him and depositing him in the alligator filled moat.\n\nThe king was at a loss as surely he would lose the battle and his kingdom in the process.  No other knights would step forward.  The king offerred his daughter's hand and half his kingdom to whoever could dispatch the message to his allies.\n\nA small page stepped forward, caring little about the kingdom but possessing an intense desire for the princess. \"I'll do it,\" he said, as he took the entreaty and placed it in the purse pages were wont to carry in those days.\n\nThe drawbridge was lowered and he scampered across as fast as his little legs would carry him.  As before, down swoops this giant yellow hand, grabbing for the page as he\nraced along, but as luck would have it, his size worked to his advantage, and he slipped between the fingers, reached the other side of the drawbridge and disappeared into the\nsafety of the forest.  The message was successfully delivered, the war was won, and he lived happily ever after with the princess on his half of the kingdom.\n\nThe moral?",

Today, while printing all the invoices, I ran out of printer paper, so I ran down to the local office supply store and picked up several boxes of Xerox MultiUse Paper.\n\nWhile the invoices were printing, I noticed something on the package of paper that concerned me, and I thought I'd better check with you about it. On the box, there is a little thing that says 99.99% jam free.  I know that sometimes wood finds its way into paper, but jam? I was always taught to keep all food and drinks away from\ncomputer equipment, especially something as sticky as jam.\n\nNow, I realize that it is a very small amount of jam in each piece of paper, but we use an awful LOT of paper, my friends, and all that jam is sure to add up.  Won't that adversely affect the life of our printer?  I mean, I'm sure you know what you're doing when it comes to paper, but we use more than the average consumer, so maybe we would be better off with a \"Jam-free\" paper, if you offer such a product.  I will look for it next time I am shopping, which will be soon, as I don't want to use any more of this paper until I find out if it's really safe.\n\nIf it is safe, why not say \"Contains .01% jam, but it's perfectly safe\" in big letters, since I'm sure that I am not the only one who has this concern.  You may end up selling a lot more paper that way.\n\nBy the way, I'm curious as to why you would even put jam in paper. Does it help bond everything together so it doesn't look like confettii? Just curious.  Also, I'd appreciate a Xerox keychain.\n\nThanks,\n\nDave Cilluffo\nPO Box 731\nEdinboro Pa 16412-0731\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you for your message.\nWe greatly appreciate your taking the time to send us your feedback regarding our 99.99% jam free paper.  We have restricted the manufacture of paper to the morning because we have so many folks who eat jam for lunch.  Nevertheless, it has been our experience that small amounts of jam have found its way into the paper via morning bagels and jam-filled\ndonuts.\n\nOur tests have shown that the .01% jam isn't harmful to machinery and you may continue to use it.  In fact the jam has improved the overall quality of the finished print.  However, you may have to keep a can of ant spray around.  You may wish to enhance paper\nperformance by using the 99.99% jam free paper with our new line of 99.99% peanut butter free paper.  They absolutely work best when used together.  Or if you prefer you can save time by using the 99.99% PB & J free paper.  Whatever you choose we are sure you will be pleased with the results. \n\nIn appreciation of your e-mail, we will be sending you a Xerox T- shirt. If we can be of other help in the future, please let us know.",
